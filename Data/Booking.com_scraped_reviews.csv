"Well, there were a few things:  - we have established via message a breakfast fee and the response was that the change has been made in the system, but this didn't happen. The staff were like, sorry, but we cannot see anything here, although I've showed the messages on my phone. Ok then, charge us with the normal price.  - ar the check-in, a green option was offered to us, for the entire stay, not to change to towels, the bedsheet, no cleaning from the cleaning lady. And we said ok, but when we asked for an extra toilet paper, the cleaning lady refused to give one to us :);  - there are no slippers offered;  - the soap from the room was almost gone, and as the green option was ""activated"", no chance to be filled with soap.",False
"The big room, all is controlled remotely, with an iPad, very clean and comfortable, surprinsgly setup for shower/wc, interesting and very chic.  Breakfast is also a plus.",True
"No sauna,no gym this is a minus! No reception only a self check in,which take to much time!",False
"New designed rooms,amazing atmosphere inside, iPad to Control lights,tv,windows and music equipment made by Marshall!  Big bathroom with great View for the City. Walking distance 5min from metro station! 10min from City center. If you go green you get free drink!",True

Toilet rolls and coffee pods didn't get replenished each day and dirty mugs didn't get taken away.  Could've done with an extra pillow and the shower had a slight sewage smell when not in use.,False
"Facilities were clean, easy to use and the bed was very comfy.",True
"So, the shower looked amazing, however there was no hot water. I didn't appreciate having to take a lukewarm shower in such a beautiful shower area, this was the biggest letdown to me.",False
"I loved almost everything about the place. So modern and trendy. I have never stayed at a hotel so lux. I was very impressed. I enjoyed the tea area directly outside my room (410). Also, there was an ironing board in this area. The location was great too, just a short metro ride into the centre. Amazing views of the trains going by (I like trains).",True
"Great room, comfy bed and big table.",True
There was a lot of noise un the morning because of the works around the hotel.,True

Nothing - only slight downside was location as it was slightly out of town and the metro only ran till 12.30am. However the hotel was so nice it made up for it!,False

"It was exceptional, will definitely be returning and I would recommend this hotel to everyone!",True
:),False
:),True
"But one thing to keep in mind is, this is rather a hotel where you just want to get in and out without much interaction with anybody which was fine for my stay. People who stay here tend to be younger and mid-age. If you aren‚Äôt so tech savvy or miss interaction with a traditional style reception look somewhere else.",False
"Great location, nice modern rooms, self check-in. It‚Äôs a modern concept of a hotel. I have no complaints about my stay here.   Came here to visit Amsterdam and the Europa League Game in football between Ajax Amsterdam vs 1.FC Union Berlin. Central Station and the football Stadium Johan Cruijff Arena are both reachable in 10 minutes from the nearby Metro. Eisern!",True
"Great place to stay, the WOW room was fantastic.",True
"Everything was fine, I have nothing to complain. It was perfect, would stay again anytime.",False
"The hotel is great value for the money. It is around 10 min with metro to city center, but really close to the metro station so it was not a problem at all going to the city center and to the train station. I stayed for 3 night on a business trip, but would definitely stay again if I would go to Amsterdam again. The staff is very nice and helpful. The check in and check out easy. For the check in it was good that some staff member was there because you have to write the name as it appears in their system, and though it said last name on the tablet, in their system appeared one of my first names (which I don't even use :) and wouldn't let me check in. If no one were there would have been impossible to figure that one out. But the staff's was great. Didn't take breakfasts, or any meal there, so for food don't know how it is. Also received a voucher for a free drink at check in, which was nice of them, didn't use it because I didn't have time. The room is clean, the bed really comfortable and the pillows were bigger that at other hotels, which for me was a plus. Was happy I chose this hotel and definitely would recommend, even if it's a bit further that the center. Also was very quite and I wasn't bothered by any noise and could work and sleep in peace. You get shampoo, soap, conditioner and lotion, but not a bathrobe, or slippers, so keep this in mind. Didn't bother me that much, just wished I took some from home :)",True

The bedroom itself was extremely comfortable and luxurious looking  The breakfast was also great   The position was very good because even if it was not in the city centre it has a very close by metro station and you can get to the centre in less than 15 mins,True
We heard the elevators go up and down every time in our room which was a bit annoying,False
Very comfy and luxuriously decorated room.,True
there wasn‚Äôt one thing I could fault about the Ruby Emma!,False
"it was stunning - from the incredible smart TV to the black out shutters you could control yourself, this hotel was like something from the future. The check-in and the check-out was so easy, all hotels should be taking notes on what the Ruby Emma does best!",True
"The room was lovely, we also loved the green approach, staff were very pleasant and helpful",True
As always the room was fantastic and the staff was welcomed and very friendly,True
"Staff not very welcoming, don't seem very happy to be there   Looked like most of staff was doing a student job rather than hotel industry professional   Breakfast expensive for a very limited choice (not hot food available at all)  No slippers in the room (available in a vending machine)  No mineral water in the room (available in a vending machine)",False
"Beautifully designed room, everything can be controlled using an iPad on the bedside table",True

the parking is a bot expensive,False

It would be nice if we could have complimentary water as it quite expensive in the vending machine (however there is a corner shop 1 minute walk away so it was fine!),False
"The rooms were amazing! Very clean, tidy bed, incredible view, beautiful bathroom and shower with a very luxurious modern look. The speaker in the room was also very high quality and this made it an even better experience as you could play music due to the rooms being soundproof. The hotel itself is impeccable and beautiful, definitely going to be staying here again!   Train station is 2min walk away and easy to use (even accepts contactless), took about 15 mins to get to the city centre.   One of the highlights of our trip was the extraordinary service given by RISHI and COP. They made sure we felt at home, greeted us with nothing but kindness and respect, and were there to accommodate us with anything we needed. They even recommended us different places to visit and they did not disappoint. Incredible guys! Big respect to RISHI and COP, and the rest of the staff.",True

"when u walk out the main door the wind just kind of hits u quite strong exp when i came during Christmas but thats it And it's something that the hotel cant rly control, qlso I wished there will be hotel slippers provided but it isnt a big issue.

nothing,False
"really clean, comfy bed and relaxing environment. would deffo stay again and recommend.",True
"Modern do it yourself check in. This might be the future and advertised to be comfortable and time saving, but at the end it is simply cost saving and impersonal. That provides a very cheap hostel feeling, not at all representing the greatness of this hotel. Reception? There is simply no reception. Just a bar table with an apple and some bar staff who might help you if you accept some waiting time. There is a bit of a youngster start up arrogance in the air.",False
"Top modern design, amazing bathroom, all to our comfort. Large rooms. Smart lighting and entertainment system. Free coffee and tea facilities, vending machines and ironing room on every floor.  Close to metro 'Spaklerweg' and Amstel served by 3 lines.",True
Not applicable cause I loved it all x,False

The noise from the trains outside. Cannot be avoided,False
"The metro was directly across the road very easy access to Amsterdam City and the airport   Very modern hotel, amazing facilities",True
The wc room is something what I didnt't like personally. But it is a matter of taste. As stated the shower cabin stands alone and the toilet is a separate room.,False
"A brand new hotel with wonderful ambience in Spaklerweg metro station neighborhood. basically it is 5 mins by feet from metro to the hotel which makes reaching any part of Amsterdam easy and comfortable. The neighborhood around the hotel is brand new and pleasant, you will find little cafe and supermarket like 3 min walk. Location, close proximity to Metro station and 15 min ride to Amsterdam Centraal makes it perfect for both business and leaisure.  Modern, very spacious rooms, equipped with design furnitures and all see-through shower cabin in the middle of the room makes it a bit kinky but brings you a real Amsterdam vibe.  Easy check-in: digital self-check-in-desk. Great lobby bar and lobby facilities. A variety of nice beers and cocktails.",True
No option to open windows for fresh air (or just didnt find it).,False
"Everything was so perfect. The room was magical, bathtub, bed, lights, i am even obsessed with the shower products Ruby offers. The localization was also very comfortable to get into the city. 10/10",True
Fantastic hotel,True
"- There wasn't a proper shower room, instead there was a frosted glass dividing the bedroom and shower though due to mirror placement it could be possible to see the person in the shower which can be awkward if you're not close friends.",False
"Very friendly and welcoming staff at check-in.  - Large windows with view over the neighbourhood and self closing blinds in the bedroom.  - Easily adjustable Temperature and lighting.  - Large flatscreen TV with airplay and chromecast for easy connectivity. They also had good wifi.  - Comfy beds, clean linen and towels.   - Large shower with two different types of showerheads.  - Shampoo and Conditioner provided.  - Charging ports by bed.   - Large desk and mirror so it's easy to do your makeup.   - In a very quiet neighbourhood away from the centre of Amsterdam.  - Only 10 minutes by metro to Centraal station (metro is very easy to navigate so I recommend staying here just to escape the busy city)",True
"Recommended. I stay regularly in this hotel. Well connected to the city centre. Rooms are comfortable, modern and very clean",True
"The self check-in is neat, but I missed the human contact, a smiling face from hotel staff upon the entrance and feeling welcome on my arrival, however that didn't affect my overall stay.",False
"I loved the room. I had truly amazing accommodation experience. Each room has it's own iPad from which you can control room temperature, different lighting, and window viewing.

The loft comes with an amazing bathtub which is perfect after a cold day in Amsterdam city. The beds are super comfortable and breakfast is delicious!,True
The high technology how everything works.,True
What I didn't like was the construction that is beside the hotel. The whole street is torn up. The noise was not bothersome but because you are swerving in and out it is easy to miss the turn off which we did and had to spend 15 minutes driving around to get back to it. This would have been nice to know beforehand. This construction will also be for a bit as it is extensive. It did not bother us in any other way outside of having to do a bit more driving as we missed the turnoff.,False
"This hotel is a great place to stay as it is not in the city but is a 5 minute walk to the metro which takes you to the Central Station of downtown Amsterdam. It provided a comfortable, quiet retreat with friendly staff. We also got the free drinks when you choose not to have daily room service. It helps to be tech savvy as you can control the lights, temperature and tv controls with the I Pad that is stationed in each room. Also provides easy instructions for streaming. The shower had lots of pressure. The parking required a bit of tech savvy but was great and easy once we sorted it out.",True

"Don‚Äôt normally leave reviews, but just back home from the Ruby Emma hotel and we were delighted with our stay. The hotel was amazing, our room was very spacious, clean and modern. The hotel has vending machines and ironing facilities on floors 2-6 which was great. The shower was excellent and the bed was very comfy. We loved the fact the room has a music speaker and Tv was easy to work. The best part of the room was the electric blinds which completely blacked the room out to get a great nights sleep. The metro is a 2 minute walk and straight into the city centre. A great little supermarket underneath the hotel and McDonald‚Äôs beside which was a (nice) surprise!   Would 100% stay again.

My experience returning to Amsterdam was made infinitely more special because of them, and I am so grateful. Deepest thanks so Rishi, Ingrid, Selena, Serena, Lee, Elena, Gabriella, Magic, and everyone who made my stay so epically wonderful! You all are the absolute best, truly. Thank you for the care, the recommendations (Selena for Rotterdam, thank you!), and in generally just being so beautiful and diverse, such a picture of what I love the most about Amsterdam.  Please see my more extensive, detailed review for this property at TripAdvisor (more space to write than here at Booking).",True

The downstairs bar has some tasty local drink options and a guitar you can borrow. The rooms are tech-advanced, with the ability to change lighting or window blinds or room temp.

Super clean, blackout blinds were heaven and I was happy that we got control over the temperature of the room (a must for someone who doesn‚Äôt deal well with the cold).  The food, although basic (as restaurant is not opened yet) was so fresh, delicious, and I felt John (staff) made it with all the love in the world.   The location was close to everywhere I needed to be and for friends to come and visit.   Sadly during our stay my son was very sick and the staff was so caring, and checking in if he was alright (it wasn‚Äôt covid and they knew that, yes they genuinely cared ‚ù§Ô∏è)   I usually stay every year (sometimes several times a year) in another hotel and I will be switching, I have already booked my next stay at Ruby ü§åüèª",True

The way the self check-in works was too technologically over-the-top : we had to register ourselves but things were not always clear and we had a problem with payment mean anyway...
