"After reading some reviews, i was a bit scared but we finally had a really great experience!!!! The hotel is located at 15 minutes by bus or tram from the city center. Very easy to go with the bus 21. Our room was lovely, looking beautiful with comfortable bedding. The bathroom was so nice. The employees were very nice and helpful with us, answering our questions and guiding us. In general the hotel is very clean, modern and the staff is friendly. * there is a luggage room to can leave the suitcases during the day before and after check out.",True
"no proper sheet provided for double bed. Front desk disobliging and when on our second night with the bed in this state the double sheets finally arrived at reception, we were told that we would have to make the bed ourselves as the receptionist was not a housekeeper! No compensation offered at all. AVOUD AT ALL COSTS",False
"Positives: The hotel was clean and tidy, no clutter or mess. Shower was great in the en-suite, large shower head. Coffee machine in room was great, could have done with more coffee pods than one a day but otherwise was good. Modern room. It was a pleasant hotel, we felt safe and the room was adequate Good transport routes into city centre (average 30 min travel time) NEGATIVES: Booked a double room and received two twin beds. Informed they only give doubles to those who book directly with them, if you're booking with booking.com you will receive two twin beds. Requested a double duvet, told they didn't have any spares and wouldn't be possible. MATTRESS WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. Only given one square pillow on each bed requested an additional pillow and was told it would be",False
Hotel advertises tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. There was none in our room. When we asked the person on reception we told it was broken and there were no spares so they could do nothing. Would not even boil a kettle for us. Completely impolite and unsympathetic towards guests who are tired and travelled a long way.,False
"I would not recommend this company as had a bad experince this weekend, had troulbe booking ino hotel took us 40 mins as the hotel said there was no names on the booking just the person whos henparty it was, was told to ring the company to which was shut. We booked a bar crawl for the friday night to meet 2 chaperones to take us round 4-5 bars with shots at every bar which was stated which we did not receive, the 2 guys that turned up was very scruffy dressed with very bad hygeine , ine of them even turnrd up with a poundkand bag, and did not have a clue where we was going and had us walking round fir ages even got lost. They was very disrespectful with the younger with tuungs they was talking about, we got to the 3rd bat to which the olser could not get in as we did not have Id",False
I stay here regularly. I find it the best hotel of its kind in amsterdam. Spacious rooms wonderfull rain shower. Coffeemachine with great coffee and ad a comfy bed. They go far further with what you expect of a 3 star hotel. The staff is exceptionally friendly and offer great service. I would stay here any time,True
Hotel was really clean and located in a really nice area staff were friendly and couldnt do enough for us short bus ride to the centre of Amsterdam. The hotel was refurbished recently and the kitchen was closed due to being refurbished. The only dowbside i would say was no spoon in the room so cant stir your coffee. Would definitely visit again.,True
"I managed to get a very favourable price for this hotel for a couple of nights. I have to admit, for the price and the looks of the outside, I didn't have very high hopes... However... I guess you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, as the hotel was extremely clean, and certainly more larger than I had realised, as the rooms obviously float over the lower shops around both corners of the building. The staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. The rooms were well equipped with a decent pod coffee maker [that also did tea :-) ]. There was a 40"" TV, the beds were comfy, there was a phone, a decent array of mains sockets and also wall mounted USB charges! The bathroom was extremely clean, with a lovely large soaker and shower wand with plenty of pressure behind both.",True
Amazing hotel room very clean and fresh! Great having tram/bus stop right outside. Lovely restaurants near by. Was worried after reading others reviews but im so happy i didn’t let it put me off. Definitely be back again.,True
"Great location to travel to and from airport and Central Amsterdam, bus stop just outside. Not so clean outside hotel or surrounding but inside hotel is clean, comfortable and Modern. Great location for food too",True
"As stated in previous comments, the hotel lobby isn't fantastic, but you don't sleep in the lobby. The room was clean and modern, with TV and wifi. The bathroom was also very clean. There is a shopping centre over the road including a Dirk, Albert Hein and Jumbo supermarkets. To get into Amsterdam centre we caught the tram which was just 5-10 minute walk. There is a bus from the airport which stops just outside of the hotel. I'd recommend this hotel especially if you're on a budget.",True
"I agree that the entrance looks old and shabby. A bit dull and lifeless sometimes but the rooms are great. The rooms are big enough. We were happy with the size of the room, the bathroom is big. The room is very clean and modern. Nice clean and comfortable beds, the pillows were a bit too high, had sore neck. Very quite at night even during the day but we were on the side facing the parking so I am not sure about the rooms above the Main Street. We had bikes, so its a good 20 minutes into the center of the city. They clean the rooms everyday and refill the coffee capsules. We paid around 300 euros for 4 nights. I think thats very cheap. I would definitely recommend this hotel. There is a supermarket across the street and a shopping centre, not so big. A few shops.",True
"Hotel was ok not great. Regular trams and buses nearby so it's easy to get around. When booking it said we'd be given the option to choose a double room or a twin room but never given that option so our couples holiday consisted of two beds. Staff at desk friendly, managed to get free late check out but at 11 a staff member started shouting at our door check out and also tried to come into the room. Also bed covers were stained despite apparently being changed. Didn't try breakfast. Cheap enough for Amsterdam but wouldn't stay again.",True
"When we arrived my first thought was I don’t want to stay here, the frontage of the hotel including the reception was very poor, not well decorated and very dated. The reception staff only confirmed our room number and the number of nights that we were staying then pontes towards the lift. The signage was good and we found are room which was a pleasant surprise, a good size with a good bath room and very modern and clean. The large window over looked a junction and traffic lights so noise was an issue. During our stay of 5 nights the staff did not speak to us again , did not engage at all. We thought we would try breakfast at an additional cost but we could not find the breakfast room. Therefore I would score this as ‘could do better’",True
"Stayed for 2 nights,,its ok but overpriced I think. Coffee machine not working reported it twice and it still wasn’t working when we checked out,,was woken the first morning at 7am by scaffolding being erected outside our room, reception is basic and employees just dressed in jogging bottoms and hoodies not professional,I honestly think it’s a 2 star and that’s all",False
"Firstly great location because trams go directly towards the main station and also to Leidseplein, Rijksmuseum, Rembrandt Square & Dam Square. The bus pretty much does the same but has an advantage because it can take directly transport you to and from the airport. The location of the hotel is fab because you are staying around Plein 40 and there are many shops, restaurants and also a supermarket. The hotel itself has fantastic and friendly staff. It was clean and tidy everyday. Staff knowledge to answer questions was fab. I would definitely stay here again. Well my next visit I will book the same hotel.",True
"This was located in a suburb and was under renovation! No info on that when I booked. Temporary front desk in middle of all construction. Staff was dressed in hoodies (not all), breakfast served in basement, dark no windows and flashing lights. The only positive was the room, it was one of the newly renovated. But, located on the ground floor and the big window facing the street and bus stop! And for the price I paid, it should delivered as a three star hotel (even if a company travel), this was a robbery!",False
"Stayed here for 4 nights in July and although there was no need to have much interaction with the staff, the front desk was polite and courteous. What was impressive were the new rooms and showers which we were told were all part of a major renovation project that was almost completed. Many aspects of the new rooms showed a lot of thought about the needs of the modern guest. The room was obviously very clean being so new. Didn’t have breakfast here, so can’t comment on that. In terms of location though - it’s a great spot to get to most of the usual suspects of Dam. Bus and tram stops literally just outside the hotel and it takes 20 mins on a bus to Amsterdam Central. Would definitely stay here again especially with regards to value for money.",True
"The hotel was under a huge facelift, which makes it hard for the guests to live with heavy dust during the stay. Elevator was so slow that we thought it was going to jam with us inside. The room I stayed was completely new, was totally reformed and very good inside, great size, great bathroom which was also very new. The room itself made the staying worth it.",True
the hotel decor was good. Its show a luxurious feeling. Meanwhile the bathroom was clean and comfortable. The room we live was used for only 2 people but its ok to stay within 4(because we brought one more sleeping bag). You can catch the 61 or 21 bus in station sloterdjik. You can see a supermarket and some restaurant nearby the hotel.,True
"After arriving in Amsterdam and having a turbulent first few hours where things were lost and bookings were cancelled, Pascal and Sarina came to the rescue. Very pleasant people to talk to and extremely helpful. The hotel is clean with excellent rooms in a rather nice and calm location. I would highly recommend this hotel and would 100% stay again! 5*+",True
"Stayed here for 3 nights in March, when we first arrived I was dreading going into it when i seen the outside of the hotel but i shouldn't have judged a book my its cover inside there was work being done but the rooms that were done were beautiful so modern with a coffee machine, we enjoyed our stay but wish I had booked somewhere closer to the city centre but over all it was a nice stay! I think itll be a great hotel when all finished",True
"The Hotel is in a predominantly Moslim area, 30 minutes to central by bus 21 or alternatively tram number 7 20minutes. We preferred the tram as you could alight close to he museums and sights. Purchasing a 24 hour ticket for trams or buses entitles you to multiple journeys throughout the 24 hour period and is good value. The Hotel was having renovations when we where there. Staff friendly and helpful",False
"Construction everywhere, inside the hotel, the sidewalk and the street, but the room was outstanding. Bathroom was small but very high class. Shower was large and very relaxing. Front desk staff extremely helpful. Only negative was that the internet was off line most of the time because of the street construction. Would highly recommend.",True
"Make sure you look in your bed for huge bed bugs before you sleep. Friends of mine in a different room had enormous bed bugs and were switched to two different rooms which all had bed bugs, and they ended up sleeping in the lobby of the hotel. Be careful!!!",False
"First thing I noticed after arriving to the hotel was that it is renovated and because of that very dusty. The noise from the street was easily heard. However, the worst started after spending the night there. Before 8 in the morning I started to hear a very very loud noises in the hotel. As I expected the noise comes from the renovation of the hotel. In my opinion this hotel should not be open during the renovation, if it is not able to guarantee the guests a silence, especially in the early morning. The noises made the sleeping impossible, and the same thing repeated every day I stayed in this hotel! Unfortunately, I would advise you to avoid this place...",False
"So when I was reading the reviews for this hotel I was so worried that it would be terrible! We got there and they were doing refurbishments, which is fine means they are sorting the problems out. Our room was really really lovely, modern and clean and no bed bugs like everyone said! The staff were also really nice Overall such a good experience for the price",True
"Although the hotel is not fancy from outside, the room is new, comfortable and big. Because the hotel is under renovation, everything is new in the room. Because of the renovation, there is dust so much. But, it wasn’t an issue for me, because the room was cleaned everyday very well. The bathroom is big and I especially like the shower. There is a coffee machine in the room. The breakfast is just 5 euros, which is good value for money. I would recommend the breakfast to everyone. The lady, who works at the breakfast room, is very nice. I also like the location ver much. Although It’s not in the city center, the hotel is just 20 minutes away from the city centre by bus. The airport is 45 minutes away by bus. The name of the bus stop is Plein 40-45. Bus stop is in front of the",True
The hotel doesn’t look very fancy from the outside and the lobby is kind of messy because they are having some maintenance done at the hotel. The check in was very quick and the reception staff was very helpful. We needed a taxi very early in the morning for the next day and when we came down it was already waiting for us thanks to the reception. The room was perfect!! 3 single beds as we asked for with a balcony ( 217) as soon as you walk in you can see that it is all new. Breakfast was terrible so we decided not to take it. You have a tram and bus stop right in front so it is very easy to get to the center. We would defenetly go back. Thanks to the hotel for the very nice room.,True
The staff is totally rude and unprofessional. I never had a treatment like that. This hotel doesn't respect it's customers. I'll never come back here again. I wish I had seen the rate in TripAdvisor before booking this hotel.,False
Over all we enjoyed our stay. Check in and out was quick and easy. Still a bit of work going on in the hotel but we had a newly refurbished room and it was really nice. Clean and comfortable. Very easy access to and from the city with bus and tram stop just outside. We didn't have breakfast here so can not comment. Nice shopping area across the road with daily market except for Sundays.,True
"After I'd booked this hotel I read the reviews - OK, I know I should have read the reviews first. However, had I read the reviews before booking then I never would have booked the hotel since they were horrendous. To my delight our rooms (a 3-bed room and a 2-bed room) were good, clean and comfortable and had obviously been recently refurbished. One negative I would say is that the beds were extremely hard to sleep on although one of my friends didn't have a problem with this. I did and subsequently didn't sleep well at all. We'd also booked to have breakfast during our 4 night stay and there was plenty of choice in the canteen type, self-service restaurant. Because of the ongoing refurbishments we had to take our lives in our hands as we walked down the stairs to get to",True
Came here on contiki. Bed bugs were so bad. Complained and was offered a new room. Woke up an hour later with bed bugs. We all ended up sleeping on the floor in the downstairs dining hall. Some people slept in their showers and still got bitten. Do not go here.,False
"Do not stay here! No amount of renovations will help! Bed bug infestations in all rooms we stayed in, every room was unbearably hot and muggy, no air conditioning & the hotel ran out of fans when they received complaints of how hot the rooms were. No fan in the bathroom, bugs on the floor & the walls were not clean. The lobby is unclean and full of timber, gyprock & building materials. Had to sleep in the downstairs dining room as no one on our tour could physically bare the heat from the rooms as there is no ventilation! The hallways smell and the carpets are very unclean! A young girl vomited down the hallway and it remained there for 2 days without being touched. Honestly, spend a little more money and go elsewhere, most people on our tour left and paid to stay at another",False
"Dirty. Old. No air conditioner. Elevator out of service. Unhelpful reception lady. Most terrible thing, bed bugsssss!!! This hotel should be closed! I've been traveling pretty much all over the world. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. A clean hostel will be wwway much better than this if you are on a budget. The day we arrived is unusually hot. The elevator is out of service so we have to carry our luggage upstairs by ourselves. There's no air conditioner in the room. Only a useless tiny fan. Sweating the whole time in the room. The rat was running in the restaurant saw by my friend. I put my ring on the bed, and it's lost. I did not mean who steal it, but the reception lady is very unhelpful with an indifferent simple response when I was checking with her. But",False
The hotel itself is awful to begin with because when we got here it was under huge renovations and was filthy dirty. Not only this but have had to spend our 2 nights here sleeping downstairs in the dining room along the booths due to all the rooms being infested with bed bugs! The guy working on our first night told us that he only works there one night a week and so therefore he didn’t care. Do not believe that a hotel infested with bed bugs should be open at all! Needs to close until the problem is 100% fixed!! Would definitely not recommend this hotel to anybody!,False
I went on Contiki in June and there were bed bugs! I thought that it may be mosquito bites at first until one of the other girls in my group went to hospital for the bites and was told that it's bed bugs. Awful experience!,False
"A large group of us stayed here for two days as part of a tour. The first thing we noticed was that the lobby was inundated in dust from construction. Oddly during our two days it appears they never bothered to even sweep this. The rooms were something else, the first thing you noticed was the damp smell in the hallways and signs of construction around a few corners. Upon entering our rooms in the afternoon we were all shocked at the heat of each and every one of them. Despite Amsterdam being relatively cool and it being 17 outside the rooms were easily 35 inside. We noticed not even a small bed side fan was provided so asked the lobby if they could assist. They said no and didnt seem bothered. The worst part of all was yet to come, over half of our rooms for the tour had BED",False
This hotel is a big dustbin. The resturant tables are too dirty. street noise is in the rooms so the sleeping is not possible. No one is recommended to select it. The beetles are running in beds. And the guests are in risk of tick sting.,False
"This hotel is awful, when we arrived we noticed it was under renovation which we were not informed of when booking. The rooms and hotel were filthy and you could smell the drains. there was no air conditioning which meant leaving the window open all day with little effect. our room was 1st floor and there was a built in restaurant directly under our room which kept us awake until the early hours. This hotel should have been closed until renovated, the owners obviously only care about money and not customer satisfaction. when I complained about the smell I was given a can of air freshener and we couldn't get a refund as the manager was unavailable until the next day.",False
"Not so far from the center of Amsterdam, you have the tram stop in front of the hotel, at few steps, you can reach the center or the airport easily. This cute hotel is for guys without claims, I have been here already two times, the first was on 2000. But after many years i found the hotel almost in the same conditions. Cheap hotel, but i will not recommend for family.",True
Upon arriving in Amsterdam it was very clear to us that there was a definite cultural difference. This was made adamant to us when we checked in to the notorious hotel nieuw Slotania....a steaming pile of dung in the middle of our room. Despite cleaners being available this evidence was merely hidden by a sparkling white towel and some budget toilet paper. The dung was not removed despite requests to members of staff. As if the non Andrex toilet tissue and pile of excrement was not enough the fact that the hotel is undergoing a hefty renovation project is a bit undesirable. Perhaps as a suggestion they should upgrade on the privy first!,False
stayed here last week all though the rooms are shabby and in need of a renovation we found them clean and tidy(exept the chairs in the room was fully of stains and blood) had clean towels every day and found all the staff friendly and helpful.. you get what you pay for,True
"Well what can I say ! We weren’t advised of any renovations when booking, which you cannot miss from the moment you walk through the boarded up doors of the hotel. There’s dirt and dust everywhere, The rooms are old stanined with I’m not sure! There’s a funny smell from the bathroom which wasn’t pleasant. People drinking and smoking in the corridors which is not allowed. On a good note transport connection to the centre was good with trams and buses outside the hotel.",False
"My two friends and I travelled to Amsterdam last weekend, for a hen party. We were booked to stay in this monstrosity for two nights. We arrived on Friday night and immediately saw that one of the main doors to the hotel was boarded up. Not a great first impression, whatever the reason for it. We walked into the hotel reception and there was a member of staff sloshing what appeared to be a mop bucket full of undiluted detergent, onto the floor. We were greeted by an affable man on the reception desk, who checked us in, informed us where the breakfast room was and reminded us of the no smoking policy. There were signs in reception, advising guests that there were some renovations being carried out in the hotel. The reception area looked run down, but we just put it down to the",False
"Booked 5 nights in Amsterdam, but didn't want to be to close to the centre so saw this hotel. 3 star, Breakfast and a safe in the room included perfect. Like a lot of others have said the area was very shady and rough. I thought the hotel would be better so was still optimistic. The entrance looked quite posh. The city tax was paid which was like 35 euros and was handed the keys. The further I went up the building the more it looked like a London council block of flats it became. There was people drinking in the hallways the decor was dated and tired. My optimism was slowly going and knew I had made a mistake with this place. I opened the door to my room to be greeted with a small box room with a tv and one small table and a fresh fragrance of sewage. The safe... well if",False
"This was the most nightmarish stay I've ever had anywhere. A little leniency given as they are going through renovations however, let me start with the room. Small, cramped, dated. Very musty, air quality is awful. Rooms are more like hostels with two bunk beds crammed in. Railings on top bunks are low and very unsafe. Holes in bathroom doors/walls etc and cracks in mirrors, it feels like you're living in a horror movie. Our blankets were stained, mine was stained brown/red and my friends' was stained in yellow. When I showed housekeeping there were no apologies, just another slightly less stained blanket was brought in return. Definitely some sort of pest, whether it be bed bugs, fleas, mites or something similar in the mattresses. I woke up with several bites on my legs.",False
"Staying in this hotel for one night was good. Although the room and hotel itself stunk, the room was fairly clean and the bathroom seemed to be updated. It didn’t seem to be the nicest area and it wasn’t close to the city centre so we found ourself riding the bus all too frequently. We left our bags at the hotel to go exploring and that is something I wouldn’t do again or recommend unless you’re a very trusting person. Anyone that stores a bag has access to the storage room which means any person with access could grab your bag a walk out! Likely our bags were still there at the en did the day, but I was concerned about it all day. Reception people were very nice and spoke good English.",True
Got beaten by bedbugs. small rooms and not clean at all. very cheap for amsterdam but lacks of essential services for the visitors. 30 mins from dam suare by tram... the only good thing was the heat... warm room all day average bathroom BED BUG .... BE CAREFULL!!!,False
"The first impression from pictures was great, but the reality is so bed, Shame for you! From my point of view such a hotel mustn't exist in Holland. The stair ways are so messy and dirty, don't wanted to touch the handles. Hall and room smell terrible. It was the worst Hotel and worst night in my Life ! Shame for you!",False
"Would rate 0 if possible. We arrived here on Friday morning, was surprised by the seemingly rough area we were based in , litter and graffiti all over the roads. However check in went smoothly, and we went up to our room. Now ... as soon as you get past the doors upstairs is where the dirty ness starts. The halls are unclean and haven’t been painted in years, woodwork falling apart and paintwork flaking away. Not to mention the carpets are ripped and desperate for replacement. The room itself we found basic but ok. Noisy from students drinking and the busy road right outside. Bedsheets clean (although we did wake up a little itchy and you don’t get much of a pillow so neck aching.) We were very impressed with the bathroom, shower nice and pressured and clean. You get a safe",False
"This hotel is clean and neat on the inside , the GREAT POINTS : - Has baggage storage - Cool breakfast area - nice wood finishes - very lovely bathrooms - free amsterdam maps - lovely receptionists - directly opposite the markets and mall - close to HALAAL food cons: - the rooms are a tad small which is ok for the price - the passages are super super long so it takes ages to get to your room if its at the end of the passage LOL but not bad All in all i loved it",True
"The hotel is fair for the price. Clean rooms, sheets and nice people. Really close to the tramm that gets you anywhere in the center of the city in 20 min. Has a supermarket and a bakery nearby. breakfast is expensive though",True
"We went to this hotel with 4 persons because of the low price on Booking.com. The entrance is very pretty, but that doesn't last long. We couldn't enter our room until 14 pm, and when we did.. it wasn't cleaned yet. Beds weren't made and we had wet towels. The cleaning service passed later while we went to visit Amsterdam. In the evening, we couldn't put on the light for some bizarre reason. At night, there was a lot of noise thanks to the students in the hotel. The emergency door was open all time at night and we had to close 2 of them. The room was not according to the pictures we saw. Though staff was friendly and helpful.",False
"You get what you pay for. I'd call this a hostel rather than a hotel though. The continental breakfast isn't too bad though although the rooms could be a bit larger. The good thing about it is it is really close to public transport, convenience stores, ATMs and restaurants. The wifi is pretty good however.",True
"Bit old. Carpets need replacing. Cheap and cheerful. Room was clean and came with a fan. Large bathroom. Would stay again. Needs a toaster in breakfast hall. Night staff very nice, shame day staff didn’t hand over that we was arriving at early hours.",True
"very dirty hotel, beds full of insects (mites and fleas), no daily cleaning of the room. not to recommend it absolutely. Our bodies are full of insects bites. There is a Strange smell on tue entire hotel but insects are the worst thing",False
"Stayed for two nights as a group of three, room was clean but a little bit on the small side, as we were not in the room that much it wasnt a major issue. The bathroom was quite modern and clean. From the outside it looks a bit old and dated but dont judge a book. Reception staff were lovely who held our bags for us before check in and after check out. Good transport links with trams and busses on the doorstep. Roughly half an hour into the city. Didnt eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that.",True
"I stayed here for 2 nights as part of a group of 50 or so travellers on a Contiki trip. This hotel was selected as the Amsterdam accomodation. We each had quad share rooms. The rooms themselves were tiny. There was no room to move or put your belongings down. This hotel is very much more what I would describe as a hostel than a hotel. In any event, for a budget price I can accept a small room. Also, bathrooms were actually quite good. The horrific part of the stay was that we had bed bugs. And not only did we have bed bugs, most other rooms also had bed bugs. Another 2 groups of 4 had bed bugs not only in their original and replacement rooms. Of these groups, one was offered 2 fresh rooms and found bed bugs in both. The second group was offered one room which also had bed",False
"Too excited to be in Amsterdam, we were very clear we wanted to stay close to the main square and the tourist places. Nieuw Stotania was once such hotel close to IBIS near the railway station. What amazed us is once you step out, you can see the canal and also an array of parked bicycles, never in my life have I seen so many bicycles parked there. The hotel lobby is nice. The rooms are extremely small, just like any other budget hotel. The rooms were clean though and well maintained. The bath room extremly cramped though. It will be difficult for a heavy person to poop with the door closed. The hotel was close the Amsterdam Square and places like Casa Rosa are at walkable distance from the hotel. It is quite safe as well. I actually did not like the public urinals which were",True
"Read reviews so you know what to expect Not a 3 star hotel standard (uk standard) worse hotel I have ever stayed in ! Yes it’s cheap but if I had know standard I would not of booked see pictures of our room and this was after we had been moved as stains on bed and horrid smells in first room they gave us ! Rooms tooo hot , very noisy ! You get what you pay",False
"The reviews do not lie! This is the worst hotel in Amsterdam and possibly Western Europe! Firstly and most importantly, there are absolutely no positives whatsoever about this hotel! IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN! IT IS THAT BAD! You could not pay me to stay here again! It is so bad that I am taking this up further to see this hotel get at least fined or preferably shut down! Nobody should have to stay here! The first thing that greets you is the horrifying and putrid smell. The entire hotel smells like urine and it is seemingly a joke to patrons to just ignore it. The carpets in the hallway have never, ever been cleaned and are stained heavily with urine, dirt and god knows what else! (see photos) The walls are also stained. In my room were stains that I am positive were semen.",False

The hotel itself was pretty basic and run down, there wasn't much too it but we didn't spend too much time at the hotel. Our tool was nice and that's all that matters! Would come here again!",True
"This hotel is definitely for those who are fine with the basics. We chose it mainly based on cost and accessibility into central Amsterdam. I would say for our stay that it wasn't quite worth the money we paid, but the transport links from the hotel are regular, reliable, and overall very good. The hotel could do with a bit of a facelift and feels a bit tired with a hostel rather than a hotel vibe to it. I think the photos capture it in its glory days; the interior is a bit shabby, and as other reviews have mentioned, the carpets are worn and dirty, and our corridor smelled of mould. Our room was functional - the beds were comfy (although we were expecting to receive a double room and instead received a twin room), and the bathroom was clean with a good shower. We were",True
"The reason we booked this hotel was the price as it was in the cheaper price range for Amsterdam. Positives - price (for Amsterdam), excellent public transport access to airport and city centre, comfy bed with clean bedding Negatives - Noisy due to being next to busy road, being above shops and due to noisy guests. Smelly room due to smell drifting up from food outlets below and smokers outside if windows were opened. Smokey in corridors too. Room was ok regarding cleanliness but the corridor carpet was filthy. Overall it's a very tired hotel in a tired part of Amsterdam. If you go wanting a cheap room with easy public transport access you'll be ok. But if you want anything more you'll be disappointed.",False
Was handy that there was a tram stop outside the hotel however that is the only positive. When we first entered our room there was a strong musty smell that we couldn't get rid of. On the first night had woken up in the morning to be joined with bugs around the bed. With further inspections saw that there was a small blood like stain that was under my pillow. Because of the state of the room we tried to stay out of it as much as possible. I have come home to wake up covered in bites from the bed so BEWARE OF BED BUGS.,False
"We liked the good public transport to and from the hotel. The breakfast for 5€ was good What we needet at the reception desk,we got.

"I stayed here for two nights during a three week trip around Europe. I stayed in a four bed room and I was pleasantly surprised to find it in a nice and clean condition, with a good sized bathroom. With two bunk beds and three of us sharing the room, there wasn't much space, but this was to be expected on a budget tour. There was also a safe in the room which gave me peace of mind when leaving important documents and belongings in the hotel. As we travelled as a group, we received an evening meal when we arrived and breakfast on both days, both of which I enjoyed. The hotel is a little far out of the city centre, so we relied on the coach or taxis to take us to and from the main city.",True
"Walls, curtains, corners, radiator were so dirty I had nightmares at night. The trash in the bathroom was full when we arrived and the keys from previous guests were under the bed. The towels were old and worn out. The area has nothing to do with Amsterdam and is far from center. Cheap but disgusting",False
"We spent 3 nights in the hotel, the receptionst was so unfriendly, we arrived app. 20minutes prior check in time and she just told us to sit down and wait. We've been waiting for about 35 mins but she did not warn us to come and check in, although a very few people were walking around the area. Fire alarm started to ring at about 1 am TWICE while we were sleeping, I went down to reception and they told me 'Someone was bathing and it is only the steam'. The steam? Come on.. The windows of the room were dirty, like someone just left their vomit on them. Breakfast was fine",False
Stayed here for 1 night only and couldn't rushed out of there quicker in the morning. Room looked like prison cell with bare walls and uncomfortable bed. Shower room was OK in comparison to the bedroom. Reception staff could not care less and welcomed us with 'you are late' on arrival!!,False
"Stayed here with contiki and on my last morning in the room, I discovered bed bugs. I brought one down to reception and received no apology for the infestation, just ""we'll spray the mattress when you leave"". I'm now covered in bites and left with a sour taste in my mouth. Highly recommend checking your sheets before you sleep or sleeping in a sleeping bag of some sort if you're there with contiki - otherwise, avoid it! Bathroom had a really nice shower though.",False
"Arrived early before the normal 2pm check in and room wasnt ready (which was expected). However, we were given another room which was available. The room was well presented. Beds were comfy. Bathroom was recently upgraded and very modern looking. However, the room was far from ready as the shower (which was not used) had orange/yellow coloured sand on floor of shower and was not cleaned the whole time we were there. A tile from the ceiling that was an access panel to the air conditioning unit contained in the ceiling was left open upon arrival and again was not closed or dealt with. The plasma tv attached to the wall had access to Netherlands channels as well as the normal British channels (including TLC, BBC ONE etc). However, only one channel really worked and that was TLC. As",True
BED BUGS..... I was in room 169 (above takeaway) and after approx. 45mins of sleep I was woken by bed bugs crawling all over me. The room was too warm and clearly unhygienic. Steer clear at all costs. The manager is well aware that this is a problem and does nothing about it. Thankfully the evening receptionist was able to relocate me to another hotel in the small hours of the morning.,False
"Stayed as part of my contiki trip. Room seemed to be recently upgraded, especially bathroom. Hallways very dated with stained carpet and smell. Good breakfast and very helpful staff. Good wifi in rooms and reception.",True
"The floor boards in the room were broken. There was a bit of a funny smell. There was free wifi. It is located by public transport so getting in to the main part of town is easy. The breakfast was not like you would get in Canada or the USA (ie it's not like a continental breakfast). I stayed here as part of a tour. If I go back to Amsterdam, I will not stay here.",False
"Stayed here with a friend to begin interrailing. Room was very hot and no air con, and the staff were generally unhelpful. The location was also poor - to get to the city centre of Amsterdam you need to take a bus or tram which takes at least 30 minutes. That said, our room was very clean and the bathroom was actually surprisingly luxurious for a hostel dorm. Although Amsterdam is a notoriously expensive city, you can do better for the money.",False
"The hotel is located at an extremely busy intersection so expect alot of noise.You can get the bus to the airport right outside the front door.The hallway was noisy while we were their due to ongoing renovations.The wi fi was free and with a good signal. The room was clean, the shower was very nice and modern. The room was cleaned daily",False
"I stayed there for 2 nights for a last minute business trip, as most of the hotels close to the city were booked up. The location is average, you must take a 30-40 minute tram/bus to reach the city centre. The room itself is basic enough, no kettle which I think should be included for over 100€ a night! The room was clean but the hall is very dirty. The carpet is terribly stained, the paint is chipped off all the walls and it has a very weird smell. There is also no air-con which makes it impossible to sleep in nearly 30 degrees weather. Opening the window is also very uncomfortable as the main road is very busy. I tried to contact this hotel by phone and it took over FIVE calls to get through to them! It is supposed to have staff on reception 24/7 but you often have to wait a",False
"Good points, clean room, bed linen, towels, comfy bed, and helpful staff. As for the rest, to say this hotel is rundown is an understatement. There is a bar that doesn't look as if it has been used for years. What looks like a conference/ballroom cordoned off it is stacked with mattresses. The corridor carpet is filthy, and I do mean filthy. The place you eat your breakfast is in the basement, dull, brown, poorly lit, and the flooring taped down. No air con, no tea/coffee making facilities, and no fridge. This hotel needs money spending on it!!!! Do I need to continue? I think not, just don't go there!!!!!",False
"I stayed there for two nights this week. It's not bad, but it's not great either. The rooms are extremely hot at night and very stuffy. It's mainly filled with kids on contiki tours, so if you're young, you'll enjoy your stay. I don't think it's pleasant for older people. It's a decent hotel if you're only in the city for a short stay.",True
"This hotel is not located conveniently in Amsterdam for the price. The room was constantly hot with no airflow to it, even with the slight opening on the window it had which made it impossible to sleep. It was very small, and very uncomfortable. The hallway to our room was so long it is hard to describe. The bike hire was expensive and the bikes are not maintained and had to swap bikes 3 times due to things going wrong with them. The member of staff on the front desk were helpful but the eftpos machine did not work so we had to pay cash which was inconvenient, and one member was sitting on the couch with his iPad and earphones in and we waited for service but they were non attentive. Overall unsatisfied.",False
"I must be mad by paying 80€ for a bed in dorm!! Hotel was old and not clean, room is just barely functioning. You pay only for a bed, there is not even a place to put your bath tower in the toilet... To be fair the location is okay. It has tram link to city centre (dam square), although you need sit on the tram for a good 1/2 hr. If I visit AMS next time, I will definitely look for other options.",False
Location The area is not too bad and has places you can explore if you are a tourist. The train also runs right in front of the hotel which is very convenient. Atmosphere You can tell the building is old but they do a good job keeping it clean. I believe there are 2 levels of rooms and breakfast is served downstairs of the lobby. room I was surprised how clean my room was. I shared it with 3 other females. There were 2 bunk beds and I was pleased with the amount of space we had in the room. I probably just got lucky with the room I got. The bathroom was clean as well. The only problem I had was when I would use the sink the water took a long time to drain and also the bathroom door was really rusty because it made a lot of noise when opened or closed. Breakfast Nothing,True
"We stayed here on tour in rooms sleeping 4 (2 double bunk beds) which was fine. The bathroom was fine, larger than I had expected actually for a budget hostel type accommodation. Cons: The hotel feels quite old and outdated and the breakfast room is a weird windowless room in the basement of the building. Pros: The buffet breakfast was very enjoyable, and a tram stop is right outside of the hotel entrance across the road making travelling in to Amsterdam central very easy. Would I choose to stay here again if I were booking my own accommodation? Probably not. I was able to book a cheaper place right inside Amsterdam central around the same time so there are definitely better choices. But do I appreciate this place being a budget option should every other place be booked up?",True
"The hotel is situated about 25-30 mins from Amsterdam Centraal railway station. You can catch a bus from the bus stop outside the station next to the tram stop at stop number one. The cost if the ticket was €3 each which was good value for money. The hotel is quite big and our room which had two bunk beds was clean and clean towels were provided. The bathroom was exceptionally clean and had a massive shower, shower gel and shampoo was provided. Having dropped of our bags and showered we caught a bus with the bus stop being in the main road about a 2-3 minute walk from the front doors of the hotel. As there were four of us in the room we were each given an electronic key, which is handy if you return back at different times to others in the room. The room was also warm, in fact",True
"The hotel looks like it is old, but I really loved it! Good prices, the team is very polite and the location is fantastic: just in front of the bus stop, the train stop, and with many stores and fast foods around. There is also a market (called ""Jumbo"") crossing the street, also in front of the hotel. It is very easy and fast to go from the Bus Station (Sloterdijk) to the hotel, and from the hotel to the city center/other tourist attractions or back to the Bus Station. Regarding the room, I took a bedroom for 2 and it was very comfortable. The bathroom is really beautiful and modern and soap/shampoo/conditioner is provided by the hotel. Everything was very clean, free wi-fi...All perfect!",True
This hotel wasn't the cheapest! But you get what you pay for!! What a vile place. Walls and carpets were filthy. Room was genuinely tiny! No card to stop cleaners coming in! Breakfast was just continental. Avoid if you can,False
"The hotels out of the centre by around 25minutes which you can get trams to the centre and back pretty easily and for €7 a day you can get into the centre and back for 24 hours. The hotel wasn't nice, the carpets were stained bad all the way through the halls and there was work being done all over the hotel so it was noisy starting around 10am. The actual room wasn't that bad, clean mattress, clean covers,pillows and towels. Floors were clean bathroom was spotless, 32"" tv on the wall... channels were mostly in Dutch but some were English but ofc this is all relevant if you want to go to Amsterdam and sit in the hotel which I didn't I was out most of the time so I didn't care. One night we did spot a mouse in the corridor. The area of the hotels really good, lots of shops, take",True
"We stayed at this hotel for only one night. Room and the toilet were clean, beds were comfortable too. One downside was that we couldn't find the TV remote, but we were able to control it using buttons on the TV itself. The breakfast in the morning was decent too.",True
"The hotel is far from center of Amsterdam, just 14 tram stations. The tram is near the hotel but this is the only advantage. The rooms are quite small and the comfort is poor for the money you pay. But, what the hell, it's Amsterdam and you can have a lot of fun! 😜",True
We stayed here in a quad room as part of a Contiki tour. As such we weren't expecting much and can't really comment on $$ value as it was all included in tour. It is not particularly central to Amsterdam but public transport is readily available nearby and taxis not too expensive. Rooms were adequate and served our purposes for the trip. Pleasantly surprised to have room serviced during the day and to have an ensuite. Rooms are small and not a lot of space for luggage etc. Also had a massive pillar right in the middle of the room which made moving around the space a little more difficult. Good for what it is - this place sits somewhere in between a backpackers and a cheap hotel... decent place to just rest your head and rinse off between full days exploring Amsterdam.,True
"This was the worst experience I ever had to a hotel! I have booked 3 nights for 450 € and this is what I got: - dirty everywhere - from the carpets on the floors to the curtains in the room - broken doors on the first floor, where our room (117) was located - we had a MOUSE in the room (or more?) roaming all night looking for food in our bags and running back to its crib when we turned on the light (see pictures with its mouse hole) - windows made of wood didn't close properly so you couldn't sleep because of the noise from the outside and the wind is passing through very easy - very, very expensive for what it offers - I have paid 150 € / night! - I stayed one night and asked for a refund the very next morning - all I got back was 200 €, so I spent 250 € for a filthy hotel",False
"This is absolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. We came for a business trip, bad planning on our part but no excuse for the dirty carpets and basic level amenities, and pretty weird things happening in the corridors. It was comparable to a poorly run hostel. I didn't feel relaxed or even safe here if I'm honest. Something that you'd only ever choose to go to if you were in absolute desperate measures. I'm not a sensationalist, look at my other reviews. This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.",False

Had a good stay here and reception were happy to help were needed.",True
"I stayed here with my two sons, and the hotel did the job. Yes, it was a bit chaotic, and grubby, but the beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was good, and the TV channels were excellent. You can eat cheaply across the road, in the market, or purchase a very nice burger/kebab meal, a couple of doors down. If you're the pampered type, who has been raised in cotton wool, then book a posh hotel, but if you don't mind a working class, mostly Turkish immigrant area, then this place is for you. The transport links were good, and I would stay here again. Maybe I got lucky.",True
"Rooms were tiny, and beds were old and horrible. We had four of us in a tiny room, which was made even worse by the massive pole in the middle of the room. It was near impossible to walk through the room as with four people, four suitcases two bunks and a massive bunk there was no room. Everything was dirty, we even had a huge Lipstick print on our wall that looked like it wasn't even attempted to be cleaned. The location isn't central at all, but there were good public transport options around.",False
Stayed in this hotel for one night...Don't get fooled by pics carpets and walls have stains all over...However service is excellent very kind and helpful staff...Clean bathroom and comfortable bed...Pillow on the lumpy side...Nice sized room...It was a nice staying for 40 euros.... However if the price is more than that go somewhere else or you will be disappointed...Price-quality was ok,True
"Stayed at This hotel for 3 nights. Lobby and hall carpets were filthy, voile curtains were black at top and looked like they hadn't been washed in months, the other curtains didn't completely close. Reception wasn't too bad for cleanliness although the windows and doors needed a good clean. The heating was temperamental and sometimes blew cold air instead of hot. On the upside, the beds are extremely comfortable and the bedding spotless. Shower and toilet also very clean. We had an okay stay but was not impressed with the standard of cleanliness on the whole. Amsterdam itself was amazing. The hotel is located quite a long way from centre but there are trams and buses every few minutes",False

The rooms are simple with two single beds, a unit and telly on the wall. The bathroom is a nice size and the shower was lovely. The staff are okay not overly happy but happy to help nether the less. On arrive the hotel gives you details of local transport link and that bit of paper becomes your life line so don't loose it! The tram fair is €7.50 per adult for all day use on all trams and buses so it means it's very affordable. There is also a night bus if your planning on having a heavy night. You will be in main Amsterdam in 20 mins where you can have access to all the sights. The telly also offers English channels. There is a",True

Our room was at the front of the hotel so was a little noisy with the tram and traffic but we didn't mind, heard no noice what so ever in the hotel so quite! Only problem we had was the shower head was broken and didn't keep up high, the breakfast is okay not much just bread, cereal and fruit. Rooms were clean and bathroom was lovely and modern. Tram route local and theres a shopping mall right across, taxis are abit pricey its about 15 min taxi into Amsterdam and about 30 min on the tram! All in all was satisfied with the price we paid.",True
"Very close to bus and tram route. Shop for drinks opposite. All receptionists friendly and helpful EXCEPT older grey haired man. Carpet needs a renew in hall and rooms. Shower fantastic power snd hot water. Breakfast did the job. All in all fantastic price for a base and go with an open mind,its not a horror story as some people have made out. As a cheap base to go out partying n sightseeing would def book again. Young students as cleaning staff came to do rooms every day and fresh towels.. All six ladies did not have a problem. Rooms a tad dusty but ee were not in them long just to change shower and sleep.",True
"Came here for a long weekend break with my friends, was dreading coming here after reading the reviews but it's not actually that bad. Reception is lovely, and the wifi is brilliant too. Our room was very basic. There's a hairdryer and a safe, bathroom was nice. There are signs all over the hotel saying no smoking but our room absolutely stunk of weed and there was so many butts out on the balcony it's clear no one bothers listening to that rule. The heating didn't work so we was always freezing cold, and as well as this we had a friend with us for the weekend - a mouse :) or maybe even several mice as we found a massive mouse hole in the wall.

"The location of this hotel id about 4 miles from central Amsterdam. Double the distance we had been told. Arriving at the hotel, we realised that the area surrounding the hotel is run down and populated mostly by immigrants. The tram stop outside of the hotel makes for a noisy atmosphere. Inside of the hotel, The reception desk was nice, this had been shown on the booking site we used... The rest though surrounding the reception was scruffy. At the top of the stairs to the bedrooms, there is a lot of looks wiring off to one side. The hallway carpets were pretty much all stain with a small amount of carpet in between. The room itself was actually not too bad. It had a bed and an en suite, even a safe to keep our valuables in. Bad points however are that the locking",False

Double check with the hotel to confirm the check-in time, we had a bad experience waiting at the reception.",True
"Booked here for 4 nights for my birthday as it was such a cheap price. After reading all the reviews on here completely slating this hotel I was completely dreading my holiday. However upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised. Yes the outside of the hotel doesn't look particularly inviting and some areas of it do need updating but our room was lovely! Modern spacious clean and with a comfy bed and clean en suite we had no complaints. Staff were polite and helped with any questions we had. The only down side is that it's a bit of a distance from the centre but the tram 14 goes everywhere you will need to go for cheap prices and the stop is right outside the hotel. Definitely doesn't deserve the slating it's getting, if you want a 5 star hotel don't be such a cheap skate and fork",True
"Some rooms have had upgrades while others haven't. I was in a twin share room and I had to rearrange the furniture so the beds were not next to each other and that we could comfortably put down 2 suitcases. There were some stains and dust on the panelling on the walls. The bathroom had modern fixtures, however it wasn't properly sealed where the old shower was. The tiling job was very poor. We had some dripping water on the floor from this. Housekeeping often didn't give us enough towels either, so we often had to go down and get a towel for the floor. Breakfast is the usual continental affair but no hot food offerings. The location of the hotel is next to a tram stop, but it takes 30 minutes to get into the heart of Amsterdam. There is a supermarket opposite, but there are",True
"Upon arrival there was a nice spacious reception with polite staff who got us checked in. Room was a nice size with a modern, clean bathroom and a clean, very comfy bed. Travel into the centre was very simple with taking just one 25 minute tram ride. Supermarkets are really close as well which allowed us to buy our own breakfast on the way into Amsterdam. There were some stains on the carpet in the corridor but that did not affect my sleep nor my stay so I shall not complain. For its price and closeness to the centre of Amsterdam I would say it was very good value for money.",True
"Much has been written already. Public areas with badly scarred walls and filthy carpets. Very gloomy reception. No bar (as stated on outside illuminated sign0 No restaurant (likewise). Breakfast room dingy with duct taped patches on the floor, basic unappetising/interesting breakfast. no evidence of interested staff apart from polite receptionists who did nothing about an immovable sink plug and blocked sink. Clientele loafing about the place which definitely has the feel of a hostel. Had to insist on a room-change on arrival as a curtain hanging off its hooks - other curtain stained, dirty grey nets, smelly (from stale smoke?) and filthy window sills when window open. Next bedroom marginally improved with clean bed-linen and modern shower-room. I do NOT recommend it. Stayed",False

Well where shall I start. Booked two rooms at the hotel for a one night stay. The first room 'room 4' was absolutely freezing with no sign of the heating working. There were mouldy curtains and paintwork which was filthy. The bedding was dirty with stains on. The carpet looked covered in stains. The whole room should not be sold and it's to be gutted and decorated. Went to reception to ask for a different room and were told there is only one room left but it is a small room. They weren't lying. One single bed and the whole room was probably about 10ft x 6ft. The bathroom was probably bigger than the bed. To be fair and credit where it's due the bathroom was quite nice and had clearly been updated however there was an old gas pipe hanging down from the ceiling obviously cut off,False

Toilet was clean and modern with a fresh towels, soap and shower gel/shampoo as well. Every day a room mistress would come and change towels and linen, so they kept our room/dorm tidy all the time.

We even called a professional company and luckily they told us she should be fine with the actions we took. So if you do think there are bed bugs: dont store your belongings on the bed, seal the clothes you wore in a bag and shower.

The room was spacious but, again, the door handle falling off, the cupboard door not closing properly and the torn wallpaper in places gave us the distinct feeling of a hotel in decline.

"Good location! Only 20 minutes to downtown by tram, which stops 10m from the hotel. Nice neighbourhood. My boyfriend and I stayed there as a last resort on a Saturday night, it was 45 euros each. When we checked in, the room smelt like sweat, it had food crumbs everywhere, the beds were undone and the garbages were over-flowing. The staff eventually came to clean, and after, it was very pleasant! The beds were very comfortable, but squeaky, and the washrooms were nice. We decided to stay another night (Sunday) since it was only 24 euros each this time.The second room was clean, but the TV wouldn't turn on. The young woman working at the front desk was quite uninviting and rude when we watched the football match on the TV in the lobby.",True

"My friends and I booked here because we were looking for a place in Amsterdam for a few nights that wasn't too expensive, and this was one of the cheapest ones. I advise you to spend a little more and avoid this place. The cleaners never cleaned anything, there was a centimetre of dust underneath my bed and the floors were quite dirty. Pretty sure we also got bedbugs from this hostel. It's also quite far from the city centre, and you have to take a 20+ minute tram into the city. I suggest staying closer to the city centre and paying a little more - it's worth it. The only good thing about this place was the breakfast, which you had to pay for (don't remember the exact price, maybe €7 or so) but there was a lot of the basic stuff there.",False

We had an AC room but the room was stuff and not great to say the least. overall the place is nice with shops and eateries close by and tram and bus to the city and the bus taking you to and from the airport. but overall the hotel is patchy and not worthy of the money..they take the money first and the rest is whatever attitude of the staff except for the great service of Abdul and the nice Chinese girl and the",True
Arrived at the hotel and checking in was easy. The walk down the narrow corridor to our room took approximately a minute and a half. I've never seen a corridor that long in my life. When we finally got to the room it was tiny and had a huge pillar in the middle of the room. Which made the already tiny room even smaller. I asked to change rooms but was told that the hotel was fully booked...not sure about that. The best part of the stay was that it only lasted 2 days.,False
"Don't get me wrong this isn't a 5* hotel but these reviews don't do it justice. The bathrooms were fantastic, the rooms were clean and they were cleaned every day we were there, no sign of mould or mice and it really wasn't that noisy. The staff were helpful and friendly and the neighbourhood was fine, plus the transport into the city is €2.90 and go every ten minutes from straight across the road. Fantastic stay, would definitely stay again.",True
"Good hotel, clean and quiet for the duration of our 4 days stay, good breakfast also. The location is also good, within walking distance from the tram that takes you everywhere. Greats restaurants nearby and right opposite a shopping centre. The hotel staff was nice and helpful, we enjoyed our stay there.",True

There was a huge column in the center of the room which made moving in the room quite difficult. The bathroom was nice.

"Having read the previous reviews we were slightly apprehensive about our stay, however we were pleasantly surprised. We were only staying one night here and it was perfect for this.

"A friend and I visited Amsterdam in October last year. When we arrived, and checked in, we proceeded to our room. Just walking through the corridor to our room we were a little concerned. When we got into the room - We didn't know what to do. There was a room on the right which was the bathroom area. It was dirty and it smelt. The area which our beds were in, was awful. There were stains on the wall, the wood near the window was rotting, and we were concerned about the cleanliness. Being two teenagers, unsure of what to do, we called our grandparents and they kindly booked another hotel for us. We left, and when checking out, the lady wasn't very pleasant.

I stayed with a contiki group. We were told we were going to be staying in a hostel and that is what it is. My room had two bunk beds and a bathroom. My bed was a little lopsided and not the most comfortable.There was a television but we did not use it. The heat is the room did not work and it s very cold. The breakfast was decent for something that was included. The hotel was basic but that should be expected when booking here. The room was also fairly clean which is all that really matters when you are just there to sleep.,False
"Just back from a four night stay at this hotel. Booked double room on arrival we were put into a very small twin room first impressions of hotel was very grubby and more hostel than hotel. Second day got moved to double room we had book it was much better still basic but clean and space to move, continental breakfast was ok. Public transport right outside and needed as hotel is approximately 20mins from city center. Overall enjoyed stay but would not return to this hotel.",True
"We booked twin room, but got double instead. When challenged the ""receptionist"" said that they are fully-booked and can't do anything. Similar story about being fully booked can be read in other reviews. Apart from that staff was simply rude. Just avoid this place and don't spoil your holidays. I almost forgot to mention the unbearable stench in the room!",False

Obviously booking a quad share i didn't expect much and during my stay i was satisfied with what was offered however if you are not on a contiki or similar trip be prepared for the hotel from hell. This place is very basic, isnt located in the best part of town and really needs a reno. 2 nights was more than long enough on contiki for me. Overall basic as they come.",False
"This hostel has carpet floors and they stink very bad, but the worst thing was that we had a mouse in our room!! There were mouse-excrements near the balcony-door and windows and the furniture was obviously damaged by the mouse. When we realized our small friend we went to the reception to tell it but the receptionist was not cooperative at all, all she said was 'oh, there's nothing I can do, we are fully booked. Open the door so the mouse can go into another room'. We didn't get any money back nor a sorry, nor another room. She told us that we have to write an email to the manager to ask for a refund, which we did but we never got any response. Don't go there, obviously the mouse problem is there for long since the receptionist wasn't surprised at all.",False
If you are looking for nice place just check for another. The service of the staff is really bad. Breakfast is just with bread and ham.. Rooms are without ventilation. No soap for hand wash. Tv was broken and even I couldn't turn it on. And the place was full with teens who were pushing the doors and hitting them during all of the night.,False
Not in the nicest or most centeral location although not far by tram or cab. Hotel staff were definitely interesting. The room was basic (101) and the shelf by our window had gone rotten to the point where u could lift it and see the dead wood. I'd recommend this hotel purely on how comfortable the bed is! It was a struggle to leave it !,True
"Not a bad hotel for the price, could do with a spruce but has potential to be a good hotel if they sorted out decaying edges and bits. The asian woman on front desk was rude, but the night staff were friendly and helpful. Cabs about 25 euros to city but trams are good and for 2.90 can't complain takes about 25 min by tram!

"We went to this hostel with 5 girls and we booked the 8 person mixed dorm for 3 nights. The only good thing a cheap price (20e/per/night). The location was really unpleasant and far away from centre, 30min by tram. Building was shabby looking outside and quite dirty on the inside, old and distateful. The room was tiny, just bunk beds and one old table. There wasn't enough of safety lockers for everyone, just 4 even when the room was suppose to be for 8 persons and there was only one wall plug! Makes no sense.. The worse thing was that there was a huge mouse problem!! We found one eating our bread in the room and there was mouse poop everywhere.. We saw them couple times more and we could here them scratching at night. The staff is aware of the problem but doesn't do anything",False
"I was not looking forward to staying in the hostel/hotel but I was pleasantly surprised; the lobby is nice, offering a few sofa's, a couple of vending machines and discounts for attractions around Amsterdam. When we got into our room, our beds were already made with a towel laid out for each of us, we had a TV that received quite a few British channels including E4, and the bathroom was lovely! The bed was quite comfy and I enjoyed my stay here! The Wi-Fi is slow but available. The only problem is the distance from the centre of Amsterdam, but, nothing that Uber or the tram couldn't solve. I recommend downloading the 9292 app on your smartphone if you are using the tram, tells you exactly what stop/tram you need for where you would like to go!",True
"The hotel is clean and tidy, the reception is efficient and helpful. The room we have chosen have a big window and we like the street view.

"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel and we felt like we were in 1970s. It is located about 20min away from Amsterdam central, opposite the tram stop. It gives us the chance to see the real Amsterdam other than the tourist routes. Rooms were quite small but tidy except the stained blood on the curtains?? The reception staff were shouting and arguing in dutch but we tried not to pay any attention to it (we were guests in their countries so maybe its normal in their culture?). Overall, the price we paid £130 for 3 nights including simple breakfast can not be beaten by these things. It was ideal for two young travellers just to spend the night somewhere. If needed, would consider this hotel again.",True

Breakfast was continental, but bread, rolls etc was very fresh and tasted good. There was cereal, boiled eggs, fruit juice, hot drinks all in all a good breakfast. Would recommend if only for short stays as is probably more like an upmarket hostel than a hotel, but good.",True
"Mould in the bathroom. No exhaust fan so bathroom fogs up a lot. Radiator doesn't work so the room was like an icebox. I had to wear 3 layers to bed each night.

Perhaps some food safety training and equipment should be provided.",False
"Our 6-bed female dorm room was nice and clean, although the ensuite bathroom made it difficult to share it with all of us. The bathroom itself was clean and provided shampoo.

There were also a few good places to get food nearby.",True

However this was nothing with what was yet to come. The second night, at 1 a.m we discovered a living mouse, running down or stuff and eating our food, so we demanded a room change. We never received and apology or an explanation and the room was never checked, moreover the receptionist was angry at us and proceeded unfriendly and unprofessional, but we got a change eventually.

Also enquirer about travel passes they work out so much cheaper! Hotel breakfast is amazing also!!",True
"Listen to the reviews, this hotel is AWFUL. It is far out, but easily accessible by tram. Please note that the last tram is 12:20am, so you have to chose whether to get home by only paying about 2 euro, or stay out late and actually enjoy your vacation and pay 20+ euros to get back to the hotel. Transportation/location was not my issue. My issue is that we (my partner and I) were placed in a room with 3 twin beds, when we requested 1 queen. We had no space for our 2 large luggage bags. The HOTEL DOES NOT HAVE CLOSETS, so be prepared to have your suit case in a corner and open it every time you need something. Because it was during NYE, no additional beds were available. The room was dusty, smelled like cigarettes, and had stains and mold (windows do not open so you have to",False

"Good price and got upgraded to a 4 bed female dorm with private ensure. Bathroom was amazing, hot water, good pressure, clean and bright with hairdryer and towels. Beds were comfortable. We had a tv and a safe in the room. Staff were friendly and helpful. Only complaint (not fault of the hotel) is the noise from the next floor up. Someone was moving furniture from 12-4 in the morning. Other than that, perfect stay.

It is actually really nice, nice modern bathroom and clean rooms. The hotel itself is a bit shabby, but clean and the staff were nice. The included breakfast is a continental buffet but it was also really nice with yoghurts, cheese, cold meats, boiled eggs etc all offered along with the toasts and cereals. The rooms are a bit small, but they have everything you need and the beds are comfortable. Most importantly for us the air con/heating worked and we were able to adjust it down because for some reason the hotels throughout Europe want their rooms to be the temperature of the sun to make up for the cold outside.

Breakfast was great provided you dodge the group meal times. Location is wonderful with trams and busses right out front.

I would recommend this hotel.",True

If you are a light sleeper you might want ear plugs. Breakfast was really good value. The bathroom was excellent compared to other places I've stayed in around Europe. It is about 20 minutes from the city and not many cafes around but there's a market right across the street. Two things that bothered me was there are no laundry facilities at this hotel and staff are unable to give accurate directions to a laundromat!

This is my second stay at this hotel and it is still ok. In contrary to another review I can confirm that there is a lift in the hotel. The continental breakfast is good value for 5 euros and plenty of it!! Once again if you are visiting Amsterdam and dont want to pay the crazy city prices this is for you. Transport to and from the hotel is very cheap and convenient both trams and buses right outside. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. I wanted to visit the windmills tour price 60 euros using public transport as advised by the staff a mere 3.70 euros. The hotel is clean and comfortable and no complaints.

It was a hotel before, but it now feels like they've just crammed as many beds as they can into the building to maximise their business. The staff at this hotel were as helpful as cardboard. In fact, I think I'd have preferred them to be cardboard, as cardboard cannot give off any hostile vibes. Upon arrival we were ""greeted"" by the two receptionists having a heated argument and told to wait two minutes. Fifteen minutes later one of them storms off to have a cigarette and calm down, only to notice us sitting there in the lobby, and decides to give us our keys (and nothing else.)

The Slotania hotel is set in the 'turkish' area of Amsterdam. The hallways are about 1km long and take quite a while to get to your room if you're the last room in the building which we were.

I have mixed feelings about this place. Neither very good nor very bad. My wife loved this hotel. But I was not very happy with the corridor. The reception and room were good.

Rooms are bright and clean, very basic – keep that in mind – free wifi in some of the rooms which is a bonus (otherwise in the lobby). The hotel hallways are probably the worst part – very long and dingy, which makes opening your room door a pleasant surprise overall. Also – safes in all the room which you can use for free (bonus) but no lockers.

However when we arrived at 3PM We had to wait 40 minutes to get into our room for some reason. Having room 194 resulted in us being the last room down a giant hall, where we couldn't get WI-FI Bathroom is surprisingly very nice, TV doesn't work and there isn't any coat hangers and the bed isn't very big. Wouldn't rule stoping here again, but as for a few more pounds there are better hotels in better locations.",True

A line of dust around the bedding where the duvet and pillow has been sat for sooooo long!! Pointed it out to reception and given a clean pillow case and duvet. No sheet. And we made it. They didn't make it for us. Place is falling apart. They deep fry everything in old fat and the lift is so small it barely fits one person and a case. The rooms are a good 4 minute walk from any exit. So u better hope there's no fire! Would not stay there again out of choice. NB: €30 taxi ONE WAY to the centre of Amsterdham.,False

The outside of the hotel isn't pleasent but the lobby is lovely and so was our room, although when the maid came in to change our bedding she gave us a pillow case which has someone's blood on it, we had to complain on how discusting and unhygienic it was. The wifi doesn't work if you're placed at the end of the hallway like me and my partner was.

It's not a hostel by any means, I think most budget hotels are a bit dated but I've stayed in far worse. my room had its own bathroom, tv, hairdryer etc, bedding and towels changed everyday. Free safe too. Staff there were fab, friendly and gave me all the info I needed. It's a little bit out of the centre but that isn't a problem, bus runs from over the road frequently, you can get the number 69 bus from the airport which stops right outside the hotel - buy yourself a 24 hour ticket for $7.50 and you can go anywhere bus tram or rail. Free maps at the hotel, loads of discount cards for attractions so I Would reccomend this hotel for a comfy",True

Only down points was the balcony (covered in cigarette buts and rubbish) and the staff were very rude and didnt seem to want to deal with guests or help at all. One brunette lady at reception in particular. Otherwise it was an enjoyable stay and good location, public transport right out front and 10 minute tram ride to centre. We bought the 3 day transport pass from primera across the road for €16 which was very good value!!",True

Overall it was a very nice experience. Rooms are clean, warm, and staff is polite and helpful. It takes 20 mins to get to the city but it it easy since there is a bus/tram stop just outside of the hotel. Albert supermarket is also just across the street, so that was really good too. We would come back again for sure.",True

I stayed only one night, i do not think i could stay longer, at least not in the room they gave me. Thin walls i could hear everything, a peculiar smell, although i can't say it was dirty. The wind was coming in from the close windows and until the heat was turn on i was freezing. Not a place to sit and a have coffees at least. Nevertheless it was easy to go from and go to the airport and easy to go downtown. One tram outside of the hotel 15 minutes ride.

I went in to the hotel thinking about the reviews and was greeted by very kind staff at reception, the rooms are very decently sized with bunk beds and a flat screen tv.. the bathroom is very nice and nothing like the 'Traveler photos' Loads of noise so if you're not there for a good time and a party look somewhere else, tram line right outside the hotel. Bus from the airport only costing €2.90 to the hotel. €7.50 for unlimited tram use for 24 hours. Also an ALDI right across the road for cheap food and drinks. Great hotel and will visit again.",True

"The rooms in this hotel were alright, but as a whole the hotel left a lot to be desired. The rooms were quite well-sized, but in our twin share room we were given one double bed and one single bed which was very strange. The bathrooms were probably the nicest part of the room, but the shower was a bit low-pressure. The hotel didn't feel particularly clean - the rooms had some stains on the carpet, but worse than that was the hallways which had many noticeable stains and smelt really horrible. Also, I was travelling with a group and one afternoon we returned home to find that none of our keys were working for any of our rooms and had to get them all replaced, which reception staff weren't very friendly about.

"As a group of four my friends and I stopped at the Nieuw Slotania Hotel on a cheap weekend break to sample the many cultural delights of Amsterdam besides the windmills, Anne Frank Museum and Van Gogh Museum. The staff on the reception area of the hotel were very friendly and helpful but this area was probably the best part of the hotel and would be better classed as a hostel. The hallways leading to the rooms smelled of weed and doors slammed all through the night with people coming and going, however, as Amsterdam is primarily more of a fun destination rather than cultural (primarily) then this is expected! The rooms were extremely basic and not particularly clean with walls being so thin you could hear the conversation of the people next door, although this was very",False
On arrival we were welcomed but had to wait 15mins as our room was not ready. Our room was fairly clean although there was hair all over the beds and floor. Our bathroom light was not working. It was almost impossible to get any rest since the slamming of doors was constant and echoed the entire hallway. Lastly the travel agent told me the hotel was 5-10 mins from the city centre... Maybe by helicopter!! We had to get a tram or bus which took at least 20mins to half hour. Transport was frequent and reliable.,False

The taxi from the airport was around 40 euros (taxis were every expensive), when we arrived the man behind reception was very helpful providing maps and transport information for our stay, this was refreshing after reviews had said the staff were rude? Our room was very basic but clean, couldnt complain as we were only using it for sleep. The only negatives id say about the hotel is the area isnt the best and is rather far out from the center, however the tram's (7, 14) and a bus (21) run outside the hotel regularly!

Unfortunately I did not sleep well at this hotel. Our room was at the end of a corridor which had a door that slammed every time someone walked through it as the door didn't have a silencer.

Food was good though.,True
"Their slogan ""Quality, without having to pay the prize..."" couldn't have been further from the truth. I dont understand what part of the hotel, which should be a hostel was 'quality.' It was dusty, dirty and old. The place hadn't had a lick of paint since opening. It was dreary, very unlike the lively and atmospheric city, Amsterdam. I came here for my birthday weekend and it was a complete disaster from start to finish. After the website seemed to suggest that the hotel with close to the city centre, we found that it was about a half an hour bus journey away.

"I spent a Saturday night in this Hostel with 6 other girls and while the place was quite ok in general (at least clean), excepting from the fact that the breakfast is announced as free on the website and then charged 5 euros per person, my advice would be not to go there if you are planning to party in Amsterdam. It would piss-off the staff if you come back tipsy and make a little bit too much noise. I'm talking by experience where because I was being noisy in the first floor hall on my way back to my room after enjoying Amsterdam nightlife, the night guard caught me from behind and brutaly throw me down on the floor instead of just asking me to stop chanting and playing with the furnitures around.

After reading the reviews of this hotel I was expecting it to be aweful but this hotel was perfect for what I needed the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.

I would highly recommend this hotel if your just looking for a place to sleep,True

The staff were friendly, they just deserve mutual respect, please and thank yous, try and smile and look a bit enthusiastic, and you'll get it back. The lobby was beautiful, ornate wood staircase, both vending machines working fine. As you go upstairs, it starts to show a little more wear and tear. The hallways were literally neverending, carpets were dated, walls dirty and showed age. Now for the room. We had a 4 person room, 2 bunkbeds. The flooring was dark oak wood laminate, it looked beautiful and modern. bunkbeds looked new, the mattresses really nice and comfy. The bathroom was definitely newly",True

Nothing horrendous to report and nothing good to report. Staff kept out of our way and room was cleaned daily.

I am unsure how the public transport was but by cab it was not too costly, averaged about 20 euro to get back to the hotel from anywhere we were really.

Breakfast was also good, but I'm not choosy here. Service was friendly and helpful. If your budget is far limited, I would recommend them. However, if you're able to spend few more bucks (not so much actually) I will definitely advice to get something near the city center. For me, the main disadvantage was to spend at least 35 minutes in a tram or bus to get to the city and another 35 minutes for going back.",True

You have to get a tram into centre of Amsterdam which takes around 20mins, really easy to figure out but gets abit annoying when your coming home after a night out (getting the night bus is a ball ache).

The hotel is situated quite far from the city centre but the tram links are fantastic. The number 14 tram takes you straight to dam square and the number 7 takes you to Liedseplein which was our personal favourite place. For the price we paid for this hotel, we can't complain.

But the beds were comfy, everything else clean and the air conditioning worked perfectly (well the heater in my case). Even though it is quite far outside of Amsterdam, you get a direct bus line (69; about 30 min.) to the airport and vice versa and a tram way line (14) into the city (22 minutes to the palace).

It's a hostel, so we expected the type of atmosphere, but it was always incredibly noisy, and the staff didn't really make any effort to control the wilder people!",False
"Found hotel easily about 20 ride on bus or tram from centre of Amsterdam. (Bus no. 69 from airport approx. 30 mins).Comfortable, warm double room after initially being given 2 single beds in smaller room but staff helpful and moved us immediately after seeing our request in writing. Helped us with bus timetable. Breakfast adequate. Room cleaned daily. Safe provided in room.",True
"As many of the previous comments, I was a bit worried to stay here because of the terrible reviews, however I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Yes it is far from the city center but the metro system is easy to use and a ticket is inexpensive. And it is in a quiet neighborhood so no loud noises throughout the night. The rooms themselves were quite large and very clean. The bathroom was very spacious. Breakfast was fair for the price (€5.00) We ate there every morning and it filled us until lunch. If you're on a budget you will be grateful to choose this hotel because it really isn't as bad as the reviews suggest.",True
Just come back from Amsterdam and stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Absolutely no problems whatsoever! Staff were friendly and room was more than fine. Didn't make it down to breakfast on time so can't comment on that. The hotel is in a predominately Turkish/North African area? But that was fine also. Overall a good experience!,True
Stayed here for two nights for our friends birthday. Chose it because it was the cheapest. We were really worried about staying here after reading the dreadful reviews. Very surprised....it wasn't all that bad! Room clean and beds made/fresh towels each day. Could not fault the bathroom - nice and modern. Free safe in the room. Reception staff were pleasant. Carpet throughout the hotel was minging though! A big bag of crisps was stolen from my room!!! I'd give the breakfast a miss also. It is far out of the centre but the tram network is excellent. If you're after somewhere cheap to sleep and shower whilst exploring Amsterdam then this hotel will serve you well......just don't forget to lock up your crisps!!!!,True
"I read the bad reviews and worried what it was going to be like (we booked for cheapness). But it was great apart from being a bit far from city centre (15-20min on tram 14 from outside hotel) and the ""city tax"" of 10 or so Euros when I paid - I didn't mind paying it but I would like to have known when I booked and not when I arrived at reception. Also a bit of noise but not too bad. Aside from this: - breakfast was good -all u can eat for 5 euros (If not included in booking) - room was small but good and cleaned everyday (good TV with 30 or so channels some in English, also good heating system in the room), en suite - friendly staff - loads of local shops (aldi, market square and shopping centre across the road, cafes, takeaways and restaurants nearby as well as bus and tram",True

"This hotel serves a purpose, it is cheap, basic with a very poor breakfast. But, notwithstanding that, no guest should have to suffer being verbally insulted by the manager. Thankfully we only stayed for one night. On arrival we found that the carpet in our room was wet all over (saturated in places) and after being told ""the hotel is full"" we were offered no apology. One member of staff came and inspected the carpet and admitted to both of us that is was wet, albeit worse in some places than others. Then as we were checking out the manager changed his mind saying the carpet was washed recently and only wet in parts, (as if this is acceptable) and still offered no apology, instead the manager insinuated that it was us who were lying. We had to keep all our possessions",False
"Aside from being a little far from the center of Amsterdam (which wasn't that big of a deal seeing that there was public transportation easily accessible), it was average in every other way. The rooms were small but each room got their own bathroom and shower, which was a nice change of pace. The bar attached to the hotel was a nice hang out spot for me and my new friends. Of course everyone wonders about wifi nowadays, and wifi was available in the lobby and VERY scarcely in the rooms. Overall, you get what you paid for.",True
"It wasn't as bad as what I thought.. Our room was nice.. There is a market across the road from the hostel, supermarket and other shops. Room was clean and people we sort of friendly.. Not always but we only used the hostel to sleep in and keep our things.. We didn't spend much time there. Yes you have to get the bus to central but it's not rocket science.. If you stay here definitely get a 72hr GVB bus and tram pass from the tourist place in town.",True
"I booked the hotel and then looked at trip advisor reviews.....Disaster! so let me share with you my take on the Hotel. The Hotel is about 10k from city centre with great transport links from outside all well explained by the staff. Rooms are 2 star at best and the décor is tired and rundown BUT they are clean, plenty of towels, good showers, comfy beds, Self service Breakfast with freshly baked croissants and a TV that works better than some of the 4 star place I've been to. The reception staff were helpful to me and always attentive. It is cheap to stay here and you get what you pay for (how much time are you in the hotel?). Its the sort of hotel that back packers and students flock to and there was some noise late into the night as people arrive back. The hotels length is",False
"Having booked the trip and only checked Trip Advisor afterwards we were expecting the worse. We were very pleasantly surprised, the young man in Reception was friendly, polite and efficient, the room was clean and the bed was clean and comfortable. The buffet style continental breakfast was well stocked. The hotel was full of young people so it was a little noisy, because young people are! The location is excellent, we got the 69 bus from the airport and walked the last 5 minutes to the hotel on a straight well lit road. The return bus stop is directly outside the hotel. trams to the centre of Amsterdam run every 10 minutes or so. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip.",True
"I think the hotel was OK, it was clean, easy toi move for all the city, the people is frendly, shots are cheap, breakfast really good, I can´t complain!! I tried Shared rooms and private and both are good, some beds are uncomfortable, but must of them are in good conditions.",True
"If you're like me and snotty little desk girls acting nonchalant and smug boils your blood then please heed my advice, and stay right away from here! Seriously, the indignant , classless attitude from the desk staff is enough to spoil your holiday so I recommend anywhere else just to avoid dealing with it. The location is not convenient if you want to spend a lot of time in the city centre, the ""storage room"" where you can leave your valuables is a ""trashed"" of sorts computer room with luggage strewn all over the place, and anyone can ask for a key and leave with anything the wish, a smorgasbord for luggage thieves a sign on the door stating ""we take no responsibility for your bags"" basically obviates their need to put a modicum of effort into your valuables safety , that sign",False
"Firstly it is adamant to express how poor the service at the front desk was; as soon as we arrived we were told our room was not ready yet, this was at 4pm, and the receptionist was incredibly unwelcoming, making me and my partner feel as though we were persistently nagging although our room was not ready 3 hours after check in, and all of this came when we had limited time to actually see the city as we only stayed for a night. The receptionist continued to treat us as though she was doing us a favour and that we were being a pain by asking every half an hour if it was ready yet. As for the hotel itself, the room was pleasant and had all the basic amenities we required, as well as a functional shower which came to be a luxury over our inter railing trip.

"I stayed four nights at the motel in which over this period my friend had his room broken into and items stolen. Our other friend whilst in the bathroom also had items stolen from his room, there was also another girl who had items stolen all within 12 hours. There was no video footage available and reception couldn't do anything. They didn't have any security which at this place is a must. Therefore we spent our last two days in our rooms as every time we left we had a fear that they would be broken into. This is the honest truth would not recommend to anyone purely on a safety basis.",False

"The hotel is not in the best area and at times felt unsafe - although it has fantastic access to public transport. I stayed in two rooms here. 2 nights in a quad share which was clean and nice. 1 night in a private room which was disgusting. There was no window in the room and the bathroom opened onto the bedroom, so it was steamy and mouldy. The staff were friendly enough and the wifi access was great. Not a bad place - but would consider elsewhere first.",True
The guy at the desk was friendly. Think he's the manager . Room was not bad but the windows were filthy could do with a right old clean. The curtains had bullet holes in them. They never cleared the mess from are room rather let it pile up. Location was far from the centre had 2 ride a tram and bus. Big 2.80 euro a time. Watch out 4 the guy at the breakfast bar he's dodgy. Breakfast was included in my deal and he tried 2 charge me 5 euro. When I didn't comply he ran upstairs like a baby 2 complain saying I was rude. Lift takes forever better of walking the stairs. There's a good shopping centre opposite which is ok.,True
"Be careful, I cancelled my room two weeks before I was meant to stay and have been charged for the stay anyway. Even calling them up the staff were incredibly rude, unhelpful and uncaring at the fact that I had been charged about 150 quid. Took me 3 days of calling up to constant delays before I even spoke to a manager. Don't ever stay here.",False

"I had an awful impression of this hotel as I first walked into the lobby, but I didn't have much of a choice because all other places had no vacancy. The staff isn't friendly, the hostel isn't really organized and some places were even dirty or had damaged furniture. I was lucky, though; my friend and I got to stay in an extremely comfortable room for 4 people, with cable TV, excellent private bathroom and brand new bunk beds. I think a part of the hostel was reformed, and we had the chance to get one of those new rooms. If you have the chance, ask for a room in the new part of the hotel.",True

Thing getting worst when we enter the hall way, cat!!! yes it is a cat just walk around like their own back yard. Inside the room is so dirty, blood stain is at the window curtain!! The room rate is not so cheap, we booked the hotel through the GTA Agency, so we were expecting to get a better services than this.

The bus 21 takes you there in about 25 min. My room was great, very clean, great shower and storage space. The staff was fine, not amazing but average.

"My partner and I stayed here for two nights in December 2012. We stayed here as part of a deal with easyjet, and the hotel was inexpensive. It was easy to see why the hotel was cheap, as there were dirty/make up fingerprints all over our room, the carpet was patchy and stained and the curtains were covered in dust and had several holes on them. The bathroom was small but clean, bar a few smears on the mirror. The beds were made but the bedding didn't appear fresh. The complimentary breakfast was basic but filling and set us up for our day of touring around the city.

It looks more hostel than hotel, but the room was OK, small, clean, with very nice bath and TV and comfy beds. We had a continental breakfast and the cappuccino was really good.

Room-very clean, size didn't matter it was a place to sleep and it wasn't that small. Clean bedding and towels every day. Breakfast-basic but edible, again I knew that when I booked. Staff-Fantastic! very helpful, spoke good English-I can't fault them. Location-So you have to take a tram, 20 minutes-ish on the 14.

The location is a bit far from the city centre - 1:30 hour walk - but it's right next to a bus stop so you can easily go around and wherever we were, there was always a bus we could take that passes by the hotel. The shower had a bit of an issue but not anything critical and the air con worked on an on and off basis - when you turned it on, it didn't stop at a certain temperature but rather turned the room into a sauna. Considering the temperature ourside, we considered that a plus rather than a minus :) overall a good place to stay.",True
THE INTRODUCTION I went with a few classmates to Amsterdam for Spring Break. We stayed in the hotel for 2 days. We were looking for somewhere cheap but close to the city. We chose this hotel because it was cheaper then hotels or hostels in the center of the city and it was a 20 minute bus or tram ride away from the central station in Amsterdam. THE TRANSPORTATION We arrived at Amsterdam Schiphol airport and took the B69 bus directly to the hotel (Stop: Plein 40-45) The hostel recommended taking a train to the central station then taking the bus to the hostel but I looked it up online and that was 1 minute faster and inefficient because of the transfer. THE LOCATION The hotel is located in a very very Turkish neighborhood. The area surrounding the hotel is a bit dreary,False
"After reading reviews for this hotel I was mildly horrified and was dreading my trip, however once I arrived I soon realise that the hotel wasn't bad at all. I didn't chose the hotel, it was part of a package I paid and was very cheap so I thought it was excellent value for money. There were four of us in my room which had two very comfy bunk beds. The bathroom was modern and spacious and the shower was better than my one at home! Fresh towels everyday and breakfast wasn't bad either (continental but still a wide choice). The hotel is situated quite far away from the town centre but we caught a tram that only took about 20 mins. There was a convenient super market across the road and reception were very helpful.

My room was facing the street, which I had anticipated to be noisy, but it wasn't at all. The bed was two twins pushed together each with it's own bedding, the room was small with just enough space to walk around the bed on all sides, not much extra space for suitcases. The bathroom was spacious enough, no bathtub but a nice shower, the sink had a crack in it, but this is a minor detail. The room was clean, the bed comfortable - pillows were a little flat, again for a night or two it's a decent place to sleep.

Positives: Room cleaned everyday & they did a good job, location next to bus route with easy access to Amsterdam, free breakfast was good, price was very good. Across from a supermarket. Shower was hot and bed was comfortable enough. They also had computers which was nice.

Simply put.... - Noisy room next to us so we didn't sleep. - Carpet in corridor smelt wet. - Toilet leaked all over the floor when flushed. - Shower filled up past the ankles and took 40 minutes to exit.,False
Stayed there in May 2012. My room- a double- was reasonably spacious. But my friends had TINY single rooms. Whole place was in need of a lick of paint/bit of a re-furb. Some parts a little grubby. Buffet breakfast was tasty & filling. Good nearby transport into the centre of Amsterdam- bout 15 mins or so by tram. Just as well as there wasn't much in the locality to do. Its a hostel so be wary if you are near a room shared by teenagers/students- parts of it can be noisy at night. Staff not the best- E.g. I got a shrug when told the Hostel Iron was out with no idea when it could be expected back.Overall an ok base if your not fussy.,False

I understand it is a low star hotel, however there a couple of things you come to expect from a HOTEL. Firstly when we arrived we had booked a twin room but were shoved into a quad share room as they had none available.We were given no option.

The room was basic very cramped, the bathroom however was fantastic, it was great to have a good shower after some of the places we stayed and all the travel we had done. Food / Restaurant was ok. There are some dodgy people hanging around the lobby but then again it is Amsterdam. The hotel staff were amazing arranged a cab to Schipol they were generally helpful. I think it offers value for money, maybe not for families but certainly solo travellers / friends.",True
"Overall not a bad hotel. This place is at the budget end of the market, and not right in the heart of the action, but it was a worthy place to rest. Locals had warned us the was 'a bad part of town' but we didn't encounter anything to support that. Don't expect five star rooms or service and you'll be fine. The rooms are quite small and not particularly well laid out, but the beds were comfortable and the showers were hot. The worst part of our stay was the stairs. Apparentlt there is either no lift, of the lift doesn't work as we were directed to lugg our bags up a couple of flights of stairs to get to our room. Despite sounding a little negative about this place, I'd hapilly stay there again.",True
"The hotel itself was just very average. It was a cramped room, not very well laid out as virtually no room to walk around and my windows opened right at the top. I'm 6 foot tall and was on my tiptoes trying to reach it! the toliet didn't seem attached to the floor either... It moved quite a bit whenever you were on it which is always worrying at the end of a big night!! Also, if you ask about directions and they say you're better getting a taxi do not trust them instantly. We were told we would not find somewhere that was in a straight line practically and they charged us 12 euros to get there... It was about a mile away. On the plus, it was very clean, the beds were fairly comfy and the staff were very reasonable, I was woken 5 minutes after checkout time and didn't make it",True

"Rather out the way, but plenty of bus and tram routes very close by, so not too much of a problem. Quite difficult to find, and two locals we spoke to advised us to ""get back on the bus and hold onto our bags"". Really wasn't that bad, the area Nieuw Slotania is located in is rather rundown, but generally fine, and we didn't encounter any trouble. We stayed in a private double room, and it was clean enough, but could have been cleaner and could do with another mirror in the bedroom, as it was a bit of a battle for two girls to share the little bathroom mirror! It's perfect if you're just looking for someplace to sleep.

In addition to that the bathroom was outside and down a corridor in a block of flats. The room and bathroom were both disgusting!! On asking to be moved the man at reception said it was not his problem and to speak to the manager who had booked us in the next morning. When we spoke to her she confirmed she was not the manager and no one else had complained to her about that room. We had not confirmed the room number yet she seemed to know exactly which room we meant. She also",False

It was a pleasant surprise, yes the entrance was very grand, and the breakfast was basic, also the staff were helpful enough although slightly abrupt. The room was clean and tidy, plenty of towels and a clean fresh bathroom. The town centre is a 20 minute bus journey away but the service 21 bus drops you pretty much outside the hotel and into the centre of town, they are very frequent, the longest I waited for one was 10 minutes and that was at 11pm.

The staff isn't nice (at all!) but you can deal with it, just don't talk with them... (Or maybe I just wasn't lucky on this matter...?) Breakfast hasn't got much variety but you'll make through the morning with it. We were in a bedroom for 6 and it had enough space for us all, also the bathroom was clean and spacious too. Also, there's a cheap supermarket (Aldi) just in front so you can buy somethings if you need them. Globally, if you're staying with friends and on a budget it's ok. But as a couples' hotel it's not that nice...",True
"We traveled there for a bachelor party, therefore we did not have any standards in mind when we arrived. However, we were surprised, that it was a disappointing experience anyway. Yes, the reception and the stairwell made me hungry for more, because it looks very high-class (Marble and wood). If it wouldn't be for this, the Hotel would have received a 5 Star rating for that price, if you asked me. So we entered the Hotel, that's were our problems started. We were a group of 17 souls, the rooms were booked, all seemed to be good, but it turned out that for some reasons, the booking got messed up by the hotel. Rooms were overbooked, and were misnamed, misspelled and... well, were should I begin with. Okay, so much about this. 120 Minutes of Lobby-housing later, we got the cards",False
We stayed at this hotel as a part of our tour and one that they didn't normally used. The staff aren't ideal for customer facing roles and seem to lack patience for anyone however if you get past this it's not that bad. The room we stayed in was sold as a double so we didn't have to share but there were 2 bunk beds and a private bathroom. The room (154) appeared to be newly renovated with a nice dark wood effect floor. The bathroom was immaculate and modern but just lacked a towel rail. The walls were a bit scuffed and needed a lick of paint but otherwise the room was smart and modern. It looks like its luck of the draw with regards to the conditions of the rooms but for what the hotel/hostel is it's not that bad. You just have to look past the questionable customer,True

The rooms were clean, fresh and the bathrooms had been renovated nicely. The included dinner was amazing - what a spread! The breakfasts provided were also more than adequate. I found the supposed free wifi access the only really frustrating aspect. I managed to gain stable access for about 10 mins in the entire 2 days we stayed. This could definitely be addressed as the kind of clientele received here are definitely interested in connecting with family and friends where possible",True

"The biggest disadvantage of this place is its location - about 25 minutes from the central station (with tramway).

"Hotel staff really helpful. Room was clean but basic but what else do you need, wasn't going to be in the room much only to sleep! Breakfast was plentiful with a choice of meats, cheeses and jams.

"Ok this was not the fanciest hostel I have stayed at in my life, but then, we paid 20€ for a night ( booked in advance and online), and it included breakfast, so that was quite good value. Our room was clean, mattresses comfy, the bathroom modern, neat and clean. Breakfast was a buffet and was quite generous. Staff was friendly, and there was free Wifi in the rooms ( vital for us backpacking and needing to check train times quite often). Only problem was location: 20min outside the city centre by tram, the surroundings were not exactly the nicest area of Copenhagen and we were a bit concerned when we got back late at night. However, Amsterdam being so expensive, we were quite happy to have a nice bed and a breakfast for 20€ !",True

"The Nieuw Slotania Hotel is very old hotel, and very cheap for families, but that's because it on the other side of town, where grocery stores and farmers market resides. The neighborhood is litter with trash, dirty sidewalks, and if you do not watch where you are going, you get hit by bicycles and motorbikes. When you first walk in the Nieuw Slotania Hotel reception, looks can be deceiving; the front desk staff was very kind and polite, and check in only require a passport. However, when we arrived at our floor (1st), the place showed true colors…RED dirty carpet, and the smell of cigarettes, liquor was apparent.

The bathroomw as also clean and looked new, which is all you can ask really. However our room was facing a small access courtyard, which meant noisy at night as people came home. This is not really the fault of the hotel though. The bar downstairs was small but good fun of an evening and the breakfast was actually very good.

Had planned to stay here for 4 nights but checked out after the first night - second worst hotel I have ever stayed in (Read my review of Hotel Boulevard Amsterdam for number 1). So so dirty and scruffy and in the middle of a council tenement housing estate - nearly an hour from the city and generally awful. Asked to move to another room as we had no running water and they grudgingly moved us to a room with a huge pillar in the middle of it - disgusting is an understatement.PLEASE TAKE HEED AND STAY AWAY - THE PHOTOS ARE A FARCE!,False

The shower head hardly worked and the tv in our room didn't work at all. The hotel itself is very strange in the layout and all the hallways in the hotel are very narrow - like galleyways on a boat and each time you need to walk down one you have to wait for other guests or staff that slowly shuffle past not giving you right of way.

I think the less 'hostel like' rooms have been refurbished, so we had 3 single beds, large TV, plenty of plug sockets (always helpful) the beds were comfy, the bathroom looked pretty brand new and very clean, we had towels and body/hand wash.

The room looked out over a busy street, but I bring earplugs with me so this was not a problem. The safe in the room worked, and we used it.

It definately needed a new lick of paint! However if what you want is a clean room with your own bathroom, and a good continental breakfast, this hotel was great value. Other things to consider before booking is that because of the value, this hotel caters for large groups of students.

I was a bit upset when they told me that WiFi was accessible only from the lobby, but maybe due to luck, I had perfect WiFi reception in my room as well! The tram station is right in front of the hotel, but it takes roughly 20min for the tram to get to the city, and you can wait up to 15-20 min for the tram itself - that's the only real downside I can think about.

"I booked the Hotel for three nights, then read the reviews, my god what had i done? However on arrival and checking in, I thought where have all these people stayed? couldn't have been this place? Staff very friendly, room clean and seviced. Ideally located out of the city, trams and buses at the door and cheap and fast, maybe 15 mins to Centraal Station. A good breakfast. Only complaint no tea, coffee or kettle in room. It is what it is a Budget Hotel. If you want more then pay more in the city.",True
"I was having an amazing European vacation and this hotel almost ruined Amsterdam for me. I was nervous about this hotel because after I had booked I read some bad reviews. I walked into the lobby and the lobby looked great, but that was just a cover. The gentlemen was friendly and checked me in. I went up the elevator and came to my floor and the doors openned and it was a whole different world. The carpets were really dirty and stained. There were gross piles of laundry just left in the hallway with no one around. I checked into my room and they were sooo tiny my boyfriend and I couldn't walk by eachother without having to move out of the way. There was this tiny closet thing where we were supposed to put our things. The tv sucked! every channel was staticky, but thats not to",False
"When my boyfriend and I arrived to this hotel, we were surprised to find out that it was located so far away from the city center. We had to travel by tram for 20-30 minutes every day to get to the sightseeing spots. The neighborhood around this hotel looks like slums. There was some bad (rotten) smell in the corridors. When we entered the room, we found that the sink was almost completely blocked, and the phone wasn't working. We requested to repair the sink and were answered ""tomorrow"". The next morning, we requested the reception lady to call someone to repair the sink problem. At first, she suggested us to try and push through the sink opening with a finger, and than said that the ""repairs person"" has just left and will only be back at the afternoon. Having written a note,",False
"We were very dissapointed during this stay. Dirty rooms, very narrow and smelly corridors. Breakfast was reasonable. But the worst thing were the bed bugs. I was bitten approximately 200 times by these tiny creatures. After a few days I contacted the hotel and they discovered a few dead bed bugs on the mattress where I slept. No apology and I strongly feel they didn't even clean the room. Don't stay at this hotel/hostel!",False
"Dirty, dingy, yuck. We stayed here for two nights in July. We would not recommend this place to anyone. When we requested two twin beds for the room, we had no idea that they were going to give us a bunk bed. That's right, a bunk bed. No luck on changing rooms, we were stuck. The carpet was brown and there was dirt and dust everywhere. Our room had a giant AC exhaust thing outside the window that was extremely loud. The irony was that we didn't have AC in our room. If you closed the window, the room got hotter than hell. It was a lose-lose situation. The hotel apparently bought these condos next door and connected them with a walkway. It's confusing and very sketchy. We didn't feel safe walking to our room even though we were on the hotel's property. There are a",False

"It not hotel, it hostel. Very dirty numbers, with dirty curtains and wet, badly smelling carpets in corridors.Only one star for this purpose ' hotel '. Only for youth which smokes directly in corridors and numbers, the smell and a smoke of marihuana is carried on a corridor. A corridor very long and close numbers. Very dirty curtains and cleaners badly clean. Mattresses in suspiciously red spots... And means of hygiene always it is less than Towels than living in number.. Walls are made of a cardboard, all is audible that occurs in adjacent numbers and a corridor...But thus the polite and good personnel on registration and in buffet. A stop of transport at the entrance of in hotel. The free Internet (3 computers in a corridor). We lived in this hotel from August, 13 till August,",False
"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during a Contiki tour. The nice check-in area did not prepare us for the ugly room- a double bed & a bunk bed pushed up against the window. The bathroom needed updating badly (chipped pink bathtub, dim lighting, just seemed dirty). The train stopped right outside the hotel though, so that was a plus. Had a buffet-style dinner one night that was actually quite good.",False
"A bit of a way outside the centre, but ok. Regular trams and buses. For the price seemed to be ok until following morning when we found bugs in our bed and felt we had been eaten alive. Alerted one of the staff on the corridor and showed him the ones we had squashed on the floor, his answer, ""not his problem"" as he walked out the door. We went down to reception and reported the issue again he wasn't really surprised or overly apologetic, just a ""oh sorry"" and continued his work. Recomend this hotel - no",False
"My partner booked a trip to Amsterdam as surprise so I didn't know where we were staying until just before we went. Needless to say he didn't check Tripadvisor before booking! I checked Tripadvisor as soon as we found out where we were going and did get a little worried about all the bad reviews. However I am fairly easy to please so went with an open mind, thinking maybe people were just being picky. I have never written a bad review about a hotel before as I normally see the good in everything. However I urge you to take this review on board before you go there! It was very easy to find with the tram/bus stop just outside so transport really wasn't a problem. Reception seemed clean and fairly welcoming. Our room although basic was clean, the view was not nice looking out",False

"the booking process is easy and pleasure. The hotel is located in a fair good location with good public access. The hotel surrounding is on construction recently. hojtel room is fairly old; however, the general condition is okay and clean. The hotel service is acceptable. The breakfast is quite simple but only acceptable.",True
"We booked through an agency but when arrived at 19:00 no details of our booking/reservation could be found. We were given a nice warm double room with our credit card details and copy of our invoice taken as a guarantee. In the morning after a very nice breakfast the Manager told us not to worry and to enjoy our holiday while he did some research as to where our reservation was. He worked tirelessly all day and left a note in our room to say everything was sorted on our return. We found the area safe with a nice market across the road and a shopping mall where you could get a lovely coffee and chat to the locals. City centre was a tram/bus ride away numbers 7,14 or 21 and took about 15 minutes.",True
"one female frontdesk is very nice; while the others soso in terms of attitude. Speak very little English. The first night there is no towel in my room. Still a clean hotel. The room is very small, so is the beds. A construction is ongoing adjacent to the hotel. Convenient to all the city center.",True
"Me and my partner stayed here in April for 2 nights. Awful. The worst hotel i have stayed in, the hotel itself is basic. The room is ok, but not to good with no electricity! Our first night our electricity went, i went down stairs to let reception politely know, i was spoken to so rudley by the so called manager who attempted to patronise me and told me it was my fault the electricity had gone as i plugged my hair straighners in. I explianed that i had previously used the exact same hair straightners (and adapter) in another hotel in Amsterdam last year and also Paris just month earlier. He refused to come to look at it, which left us with no electricity for a whole night. When we left the next day we retuned to find it working and the plug sockets changed! So it was clearly",False

"This hotel is a 15 min tram or bus ride from central amsterdam and the stop is directly outside the hotel (one-way ticket cost 2.40euro). The local area offers, a supermarket, shopping centre, a few restaurants, pubs and fast food places. The accomodation is cheap and basic, rooms range from bunk bed dorms to single rooms, doubles or triples. So all price ranges are covered. A free breakfast is offered, free internet access, free use of safes and a luggage room. The hotel itself is old and a bit shabby but always clean, Many young backpackers stay here so it can get noisy. There is a bar in the hotel offering pretty cheap drinks (compared to the prices in town).",True
"If you are planning a trip to amsterdam .. please do not choose this hotel.. !.. the hotel is located very far from the city centre and you have to walk about 2 kms to get a tram .. which takes about 25-30 mins to take you to the centre.. the neighbourhood is dirty, dangerous and noisy and is a very cheap and remote part of the city.. staying in this hotel you will miss out on so much the city has to offer.. the hotel staff is extremely unprofessional, rude and was even drunk on one of the nights.. our clothes and some other accessories were probably taken away by the house keeping staff and reception desk was extremely indifferent to the incident.. the rooms are very very small though they were clean.. i strongly recommend avoiding this hotel!",False
"Stayed here 26-29 March - booking it on the airmiles website where it is listed as 3 star -no way. This is basic 1 star hostel accomodation - well it is if you are allocated a room in the annex like we were. Very small rooms, paper thin walls, cracked windows, transparent curtains, no room service, large groups of teenagres - and all this a half hour tram ride to the city of amsterdam. I would have no complaints if it was marketed as a hostel - but am annoyed that I booked this as a 3 star hotel and paid £80 per night.",False
"Last August I needed one night's cheap accommodation in Amsterdam, and booked at the Nieuw Slotania. Unfortunately I mistook the date, and booked it, not one month and three days ahead, but just 3 days ahead. I immediately realised my mistake and telephoned the hotel to ask if they could alter the date - they instructed me to alter the date through the website I had used. However I found the website had no facilities to amend or cancel the booking and instructed users to contact the hotel directly. I emailed the Nieu Slotania to point this out, but got nowhere, so I emailed them again formally cancelling the booking unless they would amend the date at no additional cost to me. I got no reply to this email. All this was completed within the next 36 hours, that is,",False
"Firstly Everyone has different reviews of this place but I think you need to look at the whole picture, would there be so many bad reviews if it was so good. Secondly I travel a lot and have to say this is right up (or down) there with the worst of them. So we arrive in amsterdam 14 of us and get the taxis to the hotel no problems about 20 mins from airport. We arrive at the hotel and are told that we cannot check in until 2:00pm, fair enough we are only 10 minutes outside the center of amsterdam (or so we are led to believe) so we decided to go for a walk some asian guy outside the hotel points out the direction to walk in, looking round the immediate area it looks rough and is predominantly turkish, all the women are in hijabs, anyway we walk for 20 minutes and Im thinking",False
"the hotel location is not central, despite what a lot of sources (hotel description officially) say. its in the suburbs, sort of ghetto. there are a few pubs and a pizza place right downstairs (9e for a pizza?), and a small grocery store (tiny) but other than that the area is kind of deserted. the tram stop is right next to the hotel though and the trip takes about 15minutes, they run pretty often, until 11:30pm or so (after which there is a night bus). you are not allowed to take food or drinks to the room....?! someone here said they put a shower cap on the fire alarm to be able to smoke inside, i tried that and it worked. we smoked by the window though. the staff is less than friendly, the room is so-so, and you cant really shower without having the whole bathroom",True
"This hotel seemed good from what i had seen on the internet, but most of all the price did draw me in. you really do get what you pay for, its cheap, dirty and nasty. the staff were rude and then pretended not to know english when i complained about our room. we booked a double onsuite room, but the bathroom was down the coridoor with no lock on it so all the men in the next room would use it and left it dirty. the breakfast was basic but more like a car boot sale then a breckfast. this hotel is situated in a very dirty scary neighbourhood, and it took 30 to 40 minutes to get in to the town each day, so that was an added cost when their website told us it was 10 minutes. basically if your looking for a cheap hotel in amsterdam, then its worth paying a small amount more to be",False
"My partner booked a weekend in Amsterdam for my 30th and we stayed at the Nieuw Hotel Slotania in Amsterdam. The accommodation is basic, but clean and comfortable. We had a double room, with a TV (several English channels available - not that you want to waste time watching tv!). The hotel also had four computers which you can use to browse the internet and check emails. These are vey popular though, so you might want to jump on one before breakfast! (ie before the teens get up!) The hotel serves a continental breakfast of cereal, plus bread, jams, cold meat and boiled eggs. The downside is that the hotel is a little way from the town centre. (about 20 to 30 mins by tram or bus). The buses and trams do run every 10 minutes though. Your best bet is to get a travel pass for",True
"This hotel is incomparable - it is located in a bad area of Amsterdam and you will regret having chosen this place! It will ruin your time in Amsterdam, which has so much to offer! As said before, the neigborhood is dangerous and dirty, a less afluent area of Amsterdam. The staff of Nieuw Slotania is not friendly: our room was not cleaned once!!! We asked them to clean it a few times and they said they would - however of course they did not. The breakfast was really bad, but we were mostly angry about the dirty and ugly room. When we left we told them that we were dissatisfied with the service: we exchanged email addresses and they promised to get in touch with us. We emailed explaining our situation again and they only replied once saying they would investigate in our case. I",False
"We stayed in the Slotainia from 16th-20th May. After reading some of the reviews left by other people after we had made the booking - We felt like we wanted to cancel but we thought we would just see how it went. The hotel its self is nothing flash. You basically get what you pay for - Cheap accomodation with friendly and helpful hotel staff. The rooms are of a clean standard (very basic) you get a bed, bathroom with Shower and a TV in the room. Also there is a complimentary breakfast of a morning between 7am - 10am which is continental but enough to set you up for the day. The only problem you may find is that from the hotel to the centre of Amsterdam is a 20minute bus/tram ride away, which can get pretty costly if your doing it 2-3 times a day or there are more than 4 or you.",True
"I have stayed at this hotel twice now. Once in May last year and April 2007. On the first trip, they gave me a twin room even though I called to confirm the details of the reservation for a double room the day before . The phone in the twin room didn't work but the bed was comfortable and the room clean. Second night they moved us to a double room where the hair dryer didn't work and the bath was dirty. For the second stay this April, the room had the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on and the sheets were too small so that I kept waking up on a bare mattress. The shower also leaked all over the floor. For those who are there for the weed, there is now a big sign up saying that marijuana can't be smoked in the hotel. Having said all that, for the price, it is not",False
